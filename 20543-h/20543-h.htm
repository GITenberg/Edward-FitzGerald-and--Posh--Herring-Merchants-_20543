7</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>There can be no better foreword to this little sketch of one 
of the phases of Edward FitzGerald&rsquo;s life than the 
following letter, written to Thomas Carlyle in 1870, which was 
generously placed at my disposal by Dr. Aldis Wright while I was 
giving the sketch its final revision for the press.&nbsp; The 
portrait referred to in the letter is no doubt that reproduced as
the photograph of 1870.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear 
Carlyle</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your &lsquo;Heroes&rsquo; put me up to sending you one 
of mine&mdash;neither Prince, Poet, or Man of Letters, but 
Captain of a Lowestoft Lugger, and endowed with all the Qualities
of Soul and Body to make him Leader of many more men than he has 
under him.&nbsp; Being unused to sitting for his <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>portrait, he 
looks a little sheepish&mdash;and the Man is a Lamb with Wife, 
Children, and dumber Animals.&nbsp; But when the proper time 
comes&mdash;abroad&mdash;at sea or on shore&mdash;then it is 
quite another matter.&nbsp; And I know no one of sounder sense, 
and grander Manners, in whatever Company.&nbsp; But I shall not 
say any more; for I should only set you against him; and you will
see all without my telling you and not be bored.&nbsp; So least 
said soonest mended, and I make my bow once more and remain 
your</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Humble Reader,<br />
&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too much has been made by certain writers, with more credulity
than discretion, of some personal characteristics of a 
great-hearted man.&nbsp; My purpose in tendering this sketch to 
the lovers of FitzGerald is to show that in many ways he has been
calumniated.&nbsp; The man who could write the letters to his 
humble friend, which are here <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>printed; the 
man who could show such consistent tenderness and delicacy of 
spirit to his fisherman partner, and could permit the enthusiasm 
of his affection to blind him to the truth, was no sulky 
misanthrope; but a man whose heart, whose intensely human heart, 
was so great as to preponderate over his magnificent 
intellect.&nbsp; Edward FitzGerald was a great poet, and a great 
philosopher.&nbsp; He was a still greater man.</p>
<p>Therefore, my readers, if, during the perusal of these few 
letters, you &ldquo;in your . . . errand reach the 
spot&rdquo;&mdash;whether it be at Woodbridge, Lowestoft, or in 
that supper-room in town &ldquo;Where he made 
one&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;. . . turn down an empty glass&rdquo; to 
his memory.</p>
<p>For there is no <i>Saki</i> to do it, either here or with the 
houris.</p>

13</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Towards the end of the summer of 1906 I received a letter from
Mr. F. A. Mumby, of the <i>Daily Graphic</i>, asking me if I knew
if Joseph Fletcher, the &ldquo;Posh&rdquo; of the 
&ldquo;FitzGerald&rdquo; letters, was still alive.&nbsp; All 
about me were veterans of eighty, ay, and ninety! hale and 
garrulous as any longshoreman needs be.&nbsp; But it had never 
occurred to me before that possibly the man who was Edward 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Image of the Mould that Man was 
originally cast in,&rdquo; the east coast fisherman for whom the 
great translator considered no praise to be too high, might be 
within easy reach.</p>
<p>My first discovery was that to most of the good people of 
Lowestoft the name of the man who had honoured the town by his 
preference was unknown.&nbsp; A solicitor <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>in good 
practice, a man who is by way of being an author himself, asked 
me (when I named FitzGerald to him) if I meant that FitzGerald 
who had, he believed, made a lot of money out of salt!&nbsp; A 
schoolmaster had never heard of either FitzGerald or Omar.</p>
<p>It was plain that the educated classes of Lowestoft could help
me in my search but little.&nbsp; So I went down to the harbour 
basins and the fish wharves, and asked of &ldquo;Posh&rdquo; and 
his &ldquo;governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a jolly boatman of middle age in the harbour but knew of 
both.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean Joe Fletcher, master?&rdquo; 
said one of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&mdash;old Posh?&nbsp; Why 
yes!&nbsp; Alive an&rsquo; kickin&rsquo;, and go a 
shrimpin&rsquo; when the weather serve.&nbsp; He live up in 
Chapel Street.&nbsp; Number tew.&nbsp; He lodge theer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So up I went to Chapel Street, one of those streets in the old
North Town of Lowestoft which have seen better days.&nbsp; A 
wizened, bent, white-haired old lady <!-- page 15--><a 
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>answered my 
knock, after a preliminary inspection from a third-floor window 
of my appearance.&nbsp; This, I learnt afterwards, was old Mrs. 
Capps, with whom Posh had lodged since the death of his wife, 
fourteen years previously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find him down at the new basin,&rdquo; 
said the old lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mostly there this time
o&rsquo; day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no Posh at the new basin.&nbsp; Half a dozen 
weather-beaten shrimpers (in their brown jumpers, and with the 
fringe of hair running beneath the chin from ear to 
ear&mdash;that hirsute ornament so dear to East Anglian 
fishermen) were lounging about the wharf, or mending the 
small-meshed trawl-nets wherein they draw what spoil they may 
from the depleted roads.</p>
<p>All were grizzled, most were over seventy if wrinkled skin and
white hair may be taken as signs of age.&nbsp; And all knew Posh,
and (oh! shame to the &ldquo;educated <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>classes!&rdquo;) all remembered Edward FitzGerald.&nbsp;
The poet, the lovable, cultured gentleman they knew nothing 
of.&nbsp; Had they known of his incomparable paraphrase of the 
Persian poet, of his scholarship, his intimacy with Thackeray, 
Tennyson, Carlyle, the famous Thompson, Master of Trinity, they 
would have recked nothing at all.&nbsp; But they remembered 
FitzGerald, who has been called by their superiors an eccentric, 
miserly hermit.&nbsp; They remembered him, I say, as a man whose 
heart was in the right place, as a man who never turned a deaf 
ear to a tale of trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said one of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a 
<i>good</i> gennleman, was old Fitz.&rdquo;&nbsp; (They all spoke
of him as &ldquo;old Fitz.&rdquo;&nbsp; They thought of him as a 
&ldquo;mate&rdquo;&mdash;as one who knew the sea and her moods, 
and would put up with her vagaries even as they must do.&nbsp; 
His shade in their memories was the shade of a friend, and a 
friend whom they respected and loved.)&nbsp; &ldquo;That was a 
good day for <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Posh when he come acrost him.&nbsp; 
Posh! I reckon you&rsquo;ll find him at Bill Harrison&rsquo;s if 
he bain&rsquo;t on the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Posh&rdquo; was no fancy name of the poet&rsquo;s for 
Joseph Fletcher, but the actual proper cognomen by which the man 
has been known on the coast since he was a lad.&nbsp; Most east 
coast fishermen have a nickname which supersedes their registered
name, and &ldquo;Posh&rdquo; (or now &ldquo;old Posh&rdquo;) was 
Joseph Fletcher&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Bill Harrison&rsquo;s is a cosy little beerhouse in the lower 
North Town.&nbsp; It is called Bill Harrison&rsquo;s because Bill
Harrison was once its landlord.&nbsp; Poor Bill has left house 
and life for years.&nbsp; But the house is still &ldquo;Bill 
Harrison&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I found Posh.&nbsp; At that time, little more than a year
ago, I wrote of him as &ldquo;a hale, stoutly-built man of over 
the middle height, his round, ruddy, clean-shaven face encircled 
by the fringe of iron-grey whiskers running round from ear to ear
beneath <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the chin.&nbsp; His broad shoulders 
were held square, his back straight, his head poised firm and 
alert on a splendid column of neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; The description would fit Posh but poorly now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was Mr. 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s partner.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t stop to 
mardle along o&rsquo; ye now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll meet ye when 
an&rsquo; where ye like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made an appointment with him, which he failed to keep.&nbsp;
Then another.&nbsp; Then another, and another.&nbsp; I lay wait 
for him in likely places.&nbsp; I stalked him.&nbsp; I caught 
stray glimpses of him in various haunts.&nbsp; But he always 
evaded me.</p>
<p>I think old Mrs. Capps got tired of leaning her head out of 
the third-floor window of No. 2 Chapel Street, and seeing me 
waiting patiently on the doorstep expectant of Posh.</p>
<p>At length I cornered him (from information received) fairly 
and squarely at the <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Magdala House, a beerhouse in 
Duke&rsquo;s Head Street, two minutes&rsquo; walk from his 
lodgings.</p>
<p>I got him on his legs and took him down Rant Score to Bill 
Harrison&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve made appointment after 
appointment, and kept none of them.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you 
wish to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posh shuffled his feet on, the sanded bricks.&nbsp; He drank 
from the measure of &ldquo;mild beer&rdquo; (twopenny), for which
he will call in preference to any other liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tha&rsquo;ss like this here, master,&rdquo; said 
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ha&rsquo; had enow o&rsquo; folks a 
comin&rsquo; here an&rsquo; pickin&rsquo; my brains and 
runnin&rsquo; off wi&rsquo; my letters and never givin&rsquo; me 
so much as a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where 
the rub is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave him a trifling guarantee of good faith, and his face 
brightened up.&nbsp; Gradually I overcame his reserve, and 
gradually I <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>persuaded him that I did not seek to 
rob him of anything.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a bit of a sailor myself, 
and I think a little talk of winds, shoals, seas, and landmarks 
did more than the trifling guarantee of good faith to establish 
friendly relations with the old fellow.</p>
<p>But he made no secret of his grievance, and I tell the tale as
he told it, without vouching for its accuracy, but confident that
he believed that he was telling me the truth.&nbsp; And, if he 
was, the man referred to in his story, the man who robbed him to 
all intents and purposes, is hereby invited to do something to 
purge his offence by coming forward and &ldquo;behaving like a 
gennleman&rdquo;&mdash;upon which I will answer for it that all 
will be forgiven and forgotten by Posh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see, master,&rdquo; said Posh, &ldquo;that was a Mr.
Earle&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know if that is the correct way of 
spelling the name, because Posh is no great authority on 
spelling; <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>but that&rsquo;s how he pronounced 
it) &ldquo;come here, that&rsquo;ll be six or seven year ago, and
he axed me about the guv&rsquo;nor, and for me to show him any 
letters I had.&nbsp; He took a score or so away wi&rsquo;m, and 
he took my phootoo and I told him a sight o&rsquo; things, 
thinkin&rsquo; he was a gennleman.&nbsp; Well, he axed me round 
to Marine Parade, where he was a stayin&rsquo; with his lady, and
he give me one drink o&rsquo; whisky.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s all 
I see of him.&nbsp; He was off with the letters and all, and 
never gave me a farden for what he had or what he l&rsquo;arnt 
off o&rsquo; me.&nbsp; I heerd arterwards as the letters was sold
by auction for thutty pound.&nbsp; I see it in the paper.&nbsp; 
If he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; sent me five pound I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
been content.&nbsp; But he niver give me nothin&rsquo; but that 
one drink.&nbsp; And ye see, master, <i>I didn&rsquo;t know as 
yew worn&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; the same breed</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to trace these letters, and to identify 
this Mr. Earle.&nbsp; Mr. Clement Shorter has been kind enough to
do his <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>best to help me.&nbsp; No record can 
be found.&nbsp; And to clinch matters, Dr. Aldis Wright (whom I 
cannot thank enough for all his kindness to me in connection with
this volume) tells me that he has never been able to find out 
where the letters are or who has them.&nbsp; One thing is 
certain: the person who took advantage of Posh&rsquo;s ignorance 
will not be able to publish his ill-gotten gains in England so 
long as any copyright exists in the letters.&nbsp; For no letter 
of FitzGerald&rsquo;s can be published without the consent of Dr.
Aldis Wright, and he is not the man to permit capital to be made 
out of sharp practice with his consent.&nbsp; I have heard 
rumours of certain letters to Posh being published in America, 
with a photograph of Posh and Posh&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;shud.&rdquo;&nbsp; They may have been published under the 
impression that they were properly in the possession of the 
person holding them.&nbsp; I know nothing of that, nor of what 
letters they are, nor who <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>published 
them, nor when and where they were issued.&nbsp; But I do know 
what Posh has told me, and if the volume (if there is one) was 
published in America by one innocent of trickery, here is his 
chance to come forward and explain.</p>
<p>I was glad to see that Posh no longer numbered me among 
&ldquo;that breed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I was no longer surprised at 
the difficulty I had experienced in getting to close quarters 
with the man.&nbsp; From that time on he was the plain-speaking, 
independent, humorous, rough man that he is naturally.&nbsp; He 
has his faults.&nbsp; FitzGerald indicates one in several of his 
letters.&nbsp; He is inclined to that East Anglian characteristic
akin to Boer &ldquo;slimness,&rdquo; and it is easy enough to 
understand that the breach between him and his 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; was inevitable.&nbsp; The marvel is 
that the partnership lasted as long as it did, and that that 
refined, honourable gentleman (and I doubt if any one was ever 
quite so perfect a gentleman as Edward <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>FitzGerald) 
was as infatuated with the breezy stalwart comeliness of the man 
as his letters prove him to have been.</p>
<p>As all students of FitzGerald&rsquo;s letters know, the 
association between FitzGerald and Posh ended in a separation 
that was very nearly a quarrel, if a man like FitzGerald can be 
said to quarrel with a man like Posh.&nbsp; But Posh never says a
word against his old guv&rsquo;nor&rsquo;s generosity and 
kindness of heart.&nbsp; He puts his point of view with emphasis,
but always maintains that had it not been for other 
&ldquo;interfarin&rsquo; parties&rdquo; there would never have 
been any unpleasantness between him and the great man who loved 
him so well, and whom, I believe in all sincerity, he still loves
as a kind, upright, and noble-hearted gentleman.</p>
<p>And as Posh&rsquo;s years draw to a close (he was born in 
June, 1838) I think his thoughts must often hark back to the days
when he was all in all to his guv&rsquo;nor.&nbsp; For <!-- page 
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>evil 
times have come on the old fellow.&nbsp; He is no longer the 
hale, stalwart man I first saw at Bill Harrison&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A little before the Christmas of 1906 he was laid up with a 
severe cold.&nbsp; But he was getting over that well, when, one 
Sunday, a broken man, almost decrepit, came stumbling to my 
cottage door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pore old lady ha&rsquo; gorn,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She ha&rsquo; gorn fust arter all.&nbsp; Pore old 
dare.&nbsp; She had a strook the night afore last, and was dead 
afore mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the circumstances of his old landlady&rsquo;s death, of 
the action of her legal personal representatives, I will not go 
here.&nbsp; It suffices to say that Posh and the other lodgers in
the house were given two days to &ldquo;clear out&rdquo; and that
I discovered that the old fellow had been sleeping in his shed on
the beach for two nights, without a roof which he could call his 
home.&nbsp; Thanks to certain readers of the <i>Daily Graphic</i>
and to the members of the Omar <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>Khayy&aacute;m Club, I had a fund in hand for 
Posh&rsquo;s benefit, and immediately put a stop to his 
homelessness.&nbsp; Indeed, he knew of this fund, and that he 
could draw on it at need when he chose.&nbsp; But I believe the 
old man&rsquo;s heart was broken.&nbsp; He has never been the 
same man since.&nbsp; The last year has put more than ten years 
on the looks and bearing of the Posh whom I met first.&nbsp; But 
his memory is still good, and I was surprised to see how much he 
remembered of the people mentioned in the letters published in 
this volume when I read them through to him the other day.&nbsp; 
He cannot understand how it is that these letters have any 
value.&nbsp; He tells me he has torn up &ldquo;sackfuls on 
&rsquo;em&rdquo; and strewn them to the winds.&nbsp; The actual 
letters have been sold for his benefit, and I think that 
FitzGerald would be pleased if he knew (as possibly he does know)
that his letters to his fisherman friend, have proved a stay to 
his old age.</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>I have done my best to give approximate dates to the 
letters, and where I have succeeded in being absolutely correct I
have to thank Dr. Aldis Wright, whose courtesy and kindliness, 
the courtesy and kindliness from a veteran to a tyro which is so 
encouraging to the tyro, have been beyond any expression of 
thanks which I can phrase.&nbsp; I hope that the letters and 
notes may help to make a side of FitzGerald, the simple human 
manly side, better known, and to enable my readers to judge his 
memory from the point of view of those old shrimpers by the new 
basin as a &ldquo;<i>good</i> gennleman,&rdquo; as a 
noble-hearted, courageous man, as well as the more artificial 
scholar who quotes Attic scholiasts in a playful way as though 
they were school classics.&nbsp; Every new discovery of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s life seems to create new wonder, new 
admiration for him; and there are, I hope, few who will read 
without some emotion not far <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>from tears 
the sentence in his sermon to Posh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let a poor, old, solitary, and sad Man (as I 
really am, in spite of my Jokes), do not, I say, let me waste my 
Anxiety in vain.&nbsp; I thought I had done with new Likings: and
I had a more easy Life perhaps on that account: <i>now</i> I 
shall often think of you with uneasiness, for the very reason 
that I had so much Liking and Interest for you.&rdquo;</p>

THE MEETING</h2>
<p>The biography of a hero written by his valet would be 
interesting, and, according to proverbial wisdom, unbiased by the
heroic repute of its subject.&nbsp; But it would be artificial 
for all that.&nbsp; Even though the hero be no hero to his valet,
the valet is fully aware of his master&rsquo;s fame; indeed, the 
man will be so inconsistent as to pride himself, and take 
pleasure in, those qualities of his master, the existence of 
which he would be the first to deny.</p>
<p>Where, however, a literary genius condescends to an intimacy 
with a simple son of sea and shore who is not only practically 
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
30</span>illiterate but is entirely ignorant of his 
patron&rsquo;s prowess, the opinions of the illiterate concerning
the personal characteristics of the genius obtain a very 
remarkable value as being honest criticism by man of man, 
uninfluenced by the spirit either of disingenuous adulation or of
equally disingenuous depreciation.&nbsp; That these opinions are 
in the eyes of a disciple of the great man quaint, almost 
insolently crude is a matter of course.&nbsp; But when they tend 
to show the master not only great in letters but great in heart, 
soul, human kindness, and generosity, they form, perhaps, the 
most notable tribute to a great personality.</p>

<p>With the exception of Charles Lamb, no man&rsquo;s letters 
have endeared his memory to so many readers as have the letters 
of Edward FitzGerald.&nbsp; But FitzGerald&rsquo;s friends (to 
whom most of the letters hitherto published were addressed) were 
cultured gentlemen, men of the first rank of the time, of the 
first rank of all time, <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>men who would necessarily be swayed 
by the charm of his culture, by the delicacy of his wit, by the 
refinement of his thoughts.</p>
<p>In the case of &ldquo;Posh,&rdquo; however (that typical 
Lowestoft fisherman who supplied &ldquo;Fitz&rdquo; with a period
of exaltation which was as extraordinary as it was 
self-revealing), there were no extraneous influences at 
work.&nbsp; Posh knew the man as a good-hearted friend, a man of 
jealous affection, as a free-handed business partner, as a lover 
of the sea.&nbsp; He neither knew nor cared that his partner (he 
would not admit that &ldquo;patron&rdquo; would be the better 
word!) was the author of undying verse.&nbsp; To this day it is 
impossible to make him understand that reminiscences of 
FitzGerald are of greater public interest than any recollection 
of him&mdash;Posh.</p>
<p>It was not easy to explain to him that it was his first 
meeting with Edward FitzGerald that was the thing and not the 
theft of his (Posh&rsquo;s) father&rsquo;s longshore lugger <!-- 
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>which led to that meeting.&nbsp; However, time and 
patience have rendered it possible to separate the wheat from the
tares of his narrative; and what tares may be left may be 
swallowed down with the more nutritious grain without any 
deleterious effect.</p>
<p>In the early summer of 1865 some daring longshore pirate made 
off with Fletcher senior&rsquo;s &ldquo;punt,&rdquo; or longshore
lugger, without saying as much as &ldquo;by your 
leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; The piracy (as was proper to such a deed of 
darkness) was effected by night, and on the following morning the
coastguard were warned of the act.&nbsp; These worthy fellows 
(and they are too fine a lot of men to be disbanded by any 
twopenny Radical Government) traced the boat to Harwich.&nbsp; 
Here the gallant rover had sought local and expert aid to enable 
him to bring up, had then raised an awning, as though he were to 
sleep aboard, and, after thus satisfying the local talent to whom
he was still indebted <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>for their services, had slunk ashore 
and disappeared.&nbsp; Old Mr. Fletcher, on hearing the news, 
started off to Harwich in another craft of his, and (fateful 
fact!) took his son Posh with him.</p>
<p>Both the Fletchers were known to Tom Newson, a pilot of 
Felixstowe Ferry, and they naturally looked him up.</p>
<p>For years Edward FitzGerald had been accustomed to cruise 
about the Deben and down the river to Harwich in a small craft 
captained by one West.&nbsp; But in 1865 he was the owner of a 
smart fifteen-ton schooner, which he had had built for him by 
Harvey, of Wyvenhoe, two years previously, and of which Tom 
Newson was the skipper and his nephew Jack the crew.&nbsp; 
According to Posh, the original name of this schooner was the 
<i>Shamrock</i>, but she has become famous as the 
<i>Scandal</i>.&nbsp; It happened that when the Fletchers were at
Harwich in search of the stolen punt, Edward FitzGerald had come 
down the <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>river, and Newson made his two 
Lowestoft friends known to his master.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that at that time, when he was 
twenty-seven years of age, Posh was an exceptionally comely and 
stalwart man.&nbsp; And he was, doubtless, possessed of the dry 
humour and the spirit of simple jollity which make his race such 
charming companions for a time.&nbsp; At all events his 
personality magnetised the poet, then a man of fifty-six, already
a trifle weary of the inanities of life.</p>
<p>FitzGerald must have been tolerably conversant with the 
Harwich and Felixstowe mariners&mdash;with the 
&ldquo;salwagers&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Ship-wash&rdquo;&mdash;and 
the characters of the pilots and fishermen of the east 
coast.&nbsp; But Posh seems to have come to him as something 
new.&nbsp; How it happened it is impossible to guess.&nbsp; Posh 
has no idea.&nbsp; He has a more or less contemptuous 
appreciation of FitzGerald&rsquo;s great affection for him.&nbsp;
But he cannot help any one to <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>get to the 
root of the question why FitzGerald should have singled him out 
and set him above all other living men, as, for a brief period of
exaltation, he certainly did.</p>
<p>From the first meeting to the inevitable disillusionment 
FitzGerald delighted in the company of the illiterate 
fisherman.&nbsp; Whether he took his prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
cruising with him on the <i>Scandal</i>, or sat with him in his 
favourite corner of the kitchen of the old Suffolk Inn at 
Lowestoft, or played &ldquo;all-fours&rdquo; with him, or sat and
&ldquo;mardled&rdquo; with him and his wife in the little cottage
(8 Strand Cottages, Lowestoft) where Posh reared his brood, 
FitzGerald was fond even to jealousy of his new friend.&nbsp; The
least disrespect shown to Posh by any one less appreciative of 
his merits FitzGerald would treat as an insult personal to 
himself.&nbsp; On one occasion when he was walking with Posh on 
the pier some stranger hazarded a casual word or two <!-- page 
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>to 
the fisherman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Fletcher is <i>my</i> 
guest,&rdquo; said FitzGerald at once, and drew away his 
&ldquo;guest&rdquo; by the arm.</p>
<p>It must have been soon after their first meeting that 
FitzGerald wrote to Fletcher senior, Posh&rsquo;s 
father:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>At this time Posh was earning his living as the 
proprietor of a longshore &ldquo;punt,&rdquo; or beach 
lugger.&nbsp; In those days there were good catches of fish to be
made inshore, and it was not unusual for a good day&rsquo;s 
long-lining (for cod, haddock, etc.) to bring in seven or eight 
pounds.&nbsp; Shrimps and soles fell victims to the 
longshoremen&rsquo;s trawls, and altogether there were a hundred 
fish to be caught to one in these days.&nbsp; Moreover, before 
steam made coast traffic independent of wind, the sand-banks 
outside the roads were a great source of profit to the beach men,
who went off in their long yawls to such craft as &ldquo;missed 
stays&rdquo; coming through a &ldquo;gat,&rdquo; or managed to 
run aground on one of the sand-banks in some way or other.&nbsp; 
The methods of the beach men were sometimes rather questionable, 
and Colonel Leathes, of Herringfleet Hall, tells a tale of a 
French brig, named the <i>Confiance en Dieu</i>, which took the 
ground on the Newcome Sand off Lowestoft <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>about the 
year 1850.&nbsp; The weather was perfectly calm, but a company of
beach men boarded her and got her off, and so established a claim
for salvage.&nbsp; As a result she was kept nine weeks in port, 
and her skipper, the owner, had to pay &pound;1200 to get 
clear.</p>
<p>All things considered, it is probable that a Lowestoft 
longshoreman, in the sixties and seventies of the nineteenth 
century, could make a very good living of it, and even now, now 
when poverty has fallen on the beach, no beach man, unspoilt by 
the curse of visitors&rsquo; tips, would bow his head to any man 
as his superior.</p>
<p>FitzGerald always took a humorous delight in the business of 
&ldquo;salwaging&rdquo; (as the men call it), and in his <i>Sea 
Words and Phrases along the Suffolk Coast</i> (No. II), he 
defines &ldquo;Rattlin&rsquo; Sam&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;A 
term of endearment, I suppose, used by Salwagers for a nasty 
shoal off the Corton coast.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same publication 
(I) he <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>defines 
&ldquo;saltwagin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So pronounced (if not 
<i>solwagin</i>&rsquo;) from, perhaps, an indistinct implication 
of <i>salt</i> (water) and <i>wages</i>.&nbsp; <i>Salvaging</i>, 
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Posh tells how his &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; would clap him 
on the back and laugh heartily over a 
&ldquo;salwagin&rsquo;&rdquo; story.&nbsp; &ldquo;You sea 
pirates!&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp; &ldquo;You sea 
pirates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1866 FitzGerald stayed at 12 Marine Terrace, 
Lowestoft, in March and April, and passed most of his time with 
Posh.&nbsp; In the evenings he would sit and smoke a pipe, or 
play &ldquo;all-fours.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the day he liked to go to 
sea with Posh in the latter&rsquo;s punt, the <i>Little 
Wonder</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Scandal</i> was not launched that year 
till June, and although he &ldquo;got perished with the N.E. 
wind&rdquo; (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 101), he revelled in 
the rough work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p39.jpg">
<img alt="12 Marine Terrace, Lowestoft" src="images/p39.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>He must have been a quaint spectacle to the Lowestoft 
fishermen, for Posh assures me that he always went to sea in a 
silk <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>hat, and generally wore a &ldquo;cross-over,&rdquo; or a
lady&rsquo;s boa, round his neck.&nbsp; Now a silk hat and a 
lady&rsquo;s boa aboard a longshore punt would be about as 
incongruous as a court suit in a shooting field.&nbsp; But 
FitzGerald was not vain enough to be self-conscious.&nbsp; He 
knew when he was comfortable, and that was enough for his healthy
intelligence.&nbsp; Why should he care for the foolish trifles of
convention?&nbsp; So to sea he went, top hat and all.&nbsp; And a
good and hardy sailor man he was, as all who remember his ways 
afloat will testify.</p>
<p>Shortly before or after his visit to Lowestoft in the spring 
of 1866 FitzGerald wrote to Posh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Markethill</span>, <span

I did not wish to let the Fish miss his mark.&nbsp; Newson was

</blockquote>
<p>The boat referred to in this letter was probably a small craft
in which FitzGerald had been in the habit of cruising up and down
river with one &ldquo;West.&rdquo;&nbsp; It certainly was not the
<i>Scandal</i>, for as transpires in the letter, that 
&ldquo;Great Ship&rdquo; was not yet painted for the yachting 
season.</p>
<p>Mr. Manby was a ship agent at Woodbridge.</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>The &ldquo;Ship-wash&rdquo; was, and is, the 
&ldquo;Rattlin&rsquo; Sam&rdquo; of Felixstowe, and Tom Newson, 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s skipper, had evidently had a good bit of 
&ldquo;salwagin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan&rdquo; is not the name of a man, but of a pointed 
buoy with a flag atop wherewith herring fishers mark the end of 
their fleets of nets, or (vide <i>Sea Words and Phrases</i>, 
etc.).&nbsp; &ldquo;A small buoy, with some ensign atop, to mark 
where the fishing lines have been <i>shot</i>; and the <i>dan</i>
is said to &lsquo;watch well&rsquo; if it hold erect against wind
and tide.&nbsp; I have often mistaken it for some floating sea 
bird of an unknown species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophecy that as soon as Posh got his longshore fleet 
complete he would wish to go on a &ldquo;lugger,&rdquo; that is 
to say, to the deep-sea fishing, was destined to be fulfilled, 
and that with the assistance of FitzGerald himself.&nbsp; But no 
one ever took Posh&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; FitzGerald&rsquo;s 
experience as a &ldquo;herring merchant&rdquo; began and ended 
with his intimacy with Posh.</p>

FitzGerald was just in time to see her masts slipping along, was 
one of the sons of &ldquo;old John Howe,&rdquo; who, with his 
wife, was caretaker of Little Grange for many years.&nbsp; The 
schooner was, Posh tells me, exceptionally cheap, and 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s reference to her meant that she was too cheap 
to be good.</p>
<p>Since Posh&rsquo;s letter-writing powers received praise from 
one so qualified to bestow it, there must have been a falling off
from want of practice, or from some other cause, for the old man 
is readier with his cod lines than with his pen by a very great 
deal, and it is difficult to believe that he ever wielded the pen
of a ready writer.&nbsp; But perhaps FitzGerald was so fascinated
by the qualities which did exist in his prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
that he saw his friend through the medium of a glamour which set 
up, as it were, a mirage of things that were not.&nbsp; Well, it 
speaks better for a man&rsquo;s heart to descry <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>non-existent 
merits than to imagine vain defects, and it was like the generous
soul of FitzGerald to attribute excellencies to his friend which 
only existed in his imagination.</p>

46</span>CHAPTER II<br />
&ldquo;REMEMBER YOUR DEBTS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In 1866 Posh became the owner of a very old deep-sea lugger 
named the <i>William Tell</i>, and, to enable him to acquire the 
nets and gear necessary for her complete equipment as a North Sea
herring boat, he borrowed a sum of &pound;50 from Tom Newson, and
a further sum of &pound;50 from Edward FitzGerald.&nbsp; 
FitzGerald thought that Newson should have security for his loan 
(vide <i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 104), but Newson refused to 
accept any such thing.&nbsp; He, too, seems to have been under 
the influence of Posh&rsquo;s fascination.&nbsp; On October 7th, 
1866, FitzGerald wrote (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 105): 
&ldquo;I am amused to see Newson&rsquo;s <i>devotion</i> to his 
young Friend. . . .&nbsp; He declined having any Bill of Sale on 
Posh&rsquo;s <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Goods for Money lent; old as he is 
(enough to distrust all Mankind) . . . has perfect reliance on 
his Honour, Industry, Skill and Luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time FitzGerald must have written the following 
fragment, in which he refers to Newson&rsquo;s loan:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You must pay him his Interest on it when 
you can, and then I will take the Debt from him, adding it to the
&pound;50 I lent you, and letting all that stand over for another
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Posh, I write all this to you, knowing you are 
as honest a fellow as lives: but I never cease hammering into 
everybody&rsquo;s head Remember your Debts, Remember your 
Debts.&nbsp; I have scarcely ever [known?] <i>any one</i> that 
was not more or less the worse for getting into Debt: which is 
one reason why I have scarce ever lent money to any one.&nbsp; I 
should not have lent it to <i>you</i> unless I had confidence in 
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>you: and I speak to you plainly now in order that my 
confidence may not diminish by your forgetting <i>one 
farthing</i> that you owe any man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other day an old Friend sent me &pound;10, which 
was one half of what he said he had borrowed of me <i>thirty 
years ago</i>!&nbsp; I told him that, on my honour, I wholly 
forgot ever having lent him any money.&nbsp; I could only 
remember once <i>refusing</i> to lend him some.&nbsp; So here is 
<i>one</i> man who remembered his Debts better than his Creditor 
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask Newson about the Cork Jacket.&nbsp; You know
that I proposed to give you each one: but your Mate told me that 
no one would wear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I lost my purse.&nbsp; I did not know where: 
but Jack had seen me slip into a Ditch at the Ferry, and there he
went and found it.&nbsp; So is this Jack&rsquo;s Luck, or mine, 
eh, Mr. Posh?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>The debt to Newson was subsequently taken over by 
FitzGerald, and a new arrangement made on the building of the 
<i>Meum and Tuum</i> in the following year.&nbsp; But this 
fragment is important, in that it strikes a note of warning, 
which had to be repeated again and again during the partnership 
between the poet and the fisherman.&nbsp; Posh was happy-go-lucky
in his accounts.&nbsp; I believe he was perfectly honest in 
intention, but he did not understand the scrupulosity in 
book-keeping which his partner thought essential to any business 
concern.</p>
<p>FitzGerald himself was very far from being meticulous where 
debts due to him were concerned.&nbsp; Dr. Aldis Wright can 
remember more than one instance in which FitzGerald tore up an 
acknowledgment of a loan after two or three years&rsquo; interest
had been paid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve paid 
enough,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s paid enough,&rdquo; 
would be his bland dismissal of the debt due to him.&nbsp; Many 
Woodbridge people had good cause <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>to know the 
generosity of the man as well as ever Posh had cause to know 
it.&nbsp; FitzGerald may not have opened his heart to his 
Woodbridge acquaintance so freely as he did to Posh, but he was 
always ready to loosen his purse-strings.</p>
<p>The cork jackets were afterwards supplied to the crew of the 
<i>Meum and Tuum</i>, as will be apparent in the letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; who found the purse, was Jack Newson, Tom 
Newson&rsquo;s nephew, and the &ldquo;crew&rdquo; of the 
<i>Scandal</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>CHAPTER III<br />
A SERMON FOR SUNDAY</h2>
<p>In 1867 Posh sold the old <i>William Tell</i> to be broken 
up.&nbsp; She was barely seaworthy and unfit to continue 
fishing.&nbsp; An agreement was entered into with Dan Fuller, a 
Lowestoft boat-builder, for a new lugger to be built, on lines 
supplied by Posh, at a total cost (including spars) of 
&pound;360.&nbsp; FitzGerald had suggested that the boat should 
be built by a Mr. Hunt, of Aldeburgh, but Posh persuaded him to 
consent to Lowestoft and Dan Fuller instead.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can 
look arter &rsquo;em better,&rdquo; said he, with some show of 
reason.</p>
<p>The agreement was, in the first instance, between Dan Fuller 
and Posh, but FitzGerald took a fancy to become partner with Posh
in the boat and her profits.&nbsp; He <!-- page 52--><a 
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>was to find 
the money for the new lugger, and to let the sums already due 
from Posh remain in the partnership, while Posh was to bring in 
the nets and gear he had.</p>
<p>But by this time FitzGerald had seen symptoms in Posh which 
caused him anxiety.&nbsp; He loved his humble friend, and his 
anxiety was on account of the man and not on account of the 
possibilities of pecuniary loss incurred through Posh&rsquo;s 
weakness.&nbsp; On December the 4th, 1866, he wrote to Mr. 
Spalding, of Woodbridge: &ldquo;At eight or half-past I go to 
have a pipe at Posh&rsquo;s, if he isn&rsquo;t half-drunk with 
his Friends&rdquo; (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 107).</p>
<p>On January 5th, 1867, he wrote to the same correspondent 
(<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 108) referring to Posh: 
&ldquo;This very day he signs an Agreement for a new 
Herring-lugger, of which he is to be Captain, and to which he 
will contribute some Nets and Gear. . . .&nbsp; I believe I have 
smoked my pipe every evening but one with Posh at <!-- page 
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>his 
house, which his quiet little Wife keeps tidy and pleasant.&nbsp;
The Man is, I do think, of a Royal Nature.&nbsp; I have told him 
he is liable to one Danger (the Hare with many Friends)&mdash;so 
many wanting him <i>to drink</i>.&nbsp; He says it&rsquo;s quite 
true and that he is often obliged to run away: as I believe he 
does: for his House shows all Temperance and Order.&nbsp; This 
little lecture I give him&mdash;to go the way, I suppose, of all 
such Advice. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fear that poor Posh&rsquo;s limbs soon grew too stiff to 
permit him to run away from the good brown 
&ldquo;bare.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the lecture which FitzGerald 
mentions so casually was surely one of the most delicately 
written warnings ever penned.&nbsp; The sterling kindness of the 
writer is as transparent in it as is his tenderness to an 
inferior&rsquo;s feelings.&nbsp; No one but a very paragon of a 
gentleman would have taken the trouble to write so wisely, so 
kindly, so tenderly, and so earnestly.&nbsp; The appeal must 
surely have <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>moved Posh, for the pathos of the 
reference to his patron&rsquo;s loneliness could not but have its
effect.</p>
<p>But to touch on the sacred &ldquo;bare&rdquo; of a Lowestoft 
fisherman is always dangerous.&nbsp; There are many teetotallers 
among them now, and they would resent any imputation on their 
temperance.&nbsp; But those who are not teetotallers would resent
it much more.&nbsp; FitzGerald warned his friend in as beautiful 
a letter as was ever written.&nbsp; But Posh could never regard 
the &ldquo;mild bare,&rdquo; the &ldquo;twopenny&rdquo; of the 
district, as an enemy.&nbsp; He rarely touched spirits.&nbsp; 
Now, at the age of sixty-nine, he enjoys his mild beer more than 
anything and cares little for stronger stuff.&nbsp; But there is 
no doubt that this same mild beer inserted the edge of the adze 
which was to split the partnership in a little more than three 
years&rsquo; time&mdash;this and the &ldquo;interfarin&rsquo; 
parties,&rdquo; whom Posh blames for all the misunderstandings 
which were to come.</p>

agree to, nothing which is not for your good.&nbsp; For surely I 
should not have meddled with it at all, but for that one 
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Poshy, I mean to read you a short Sermon, 
which you can keep till Sunday to read.&nbsp; You know I told you
of <i>one</i> danger&mdash;and I do think the only one&mdash;you 
are liable to&mdash;<i>Drink</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not the least think you are <i>given</i> to <!-- 
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>it: but you have, and will have, so many friends who 
will press you to it: perhaps <i>I</i> myself have been 
one.&nbsp; And when you keep so long without <i>food</i>; 
<i>could</i> you do so, Posh, without a Drink&mdash;of some your 
bad Beer [<i>sic</i>] too&mdash;now and then?&nbsp; And then, 
does not the Drink&mdash;and of bad Stuff&mdash;take away 
Appetite for the time?&nbsp; And will, if continued, so spoil the
stomach that it will not bear anything <i>but</i> Drink.&nbsp; 
And this evil comes upon us gradually, without our knowing how it
grows.&nbsp; That is why I warn you, Posh.&nbsp; If I am wrong in
thinking you want my warning, you must forgive me, believing that
I should not warn at all if I were not much interested in your 
welfare.&nbsp; I know that you do your best to keep out at sea, 
and watch on shore, for anything that will bring home something 
for Wife and Family.&nbsp; But do not do so at any such risk as I
talk of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, I tell you all this for your sake: and something
for my own also&mdash;not as <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>regards the 
Lugger&mdash;but because, thinking you, as I do, so good a 
Fellow, and being glad of your Company; and taking 
<i>Pleasure</i> in seeing you prosper; I should now be sorely 
vext if you went away from what I believe you to be.&nbsp; Only, 
whether you do well or ill, <i>show me all above-board</i>, as I 
really think you have done; and do not let a poor old, solitary, 
and sad Man (as I really am, in spite of my Jokes), do not, I 
say, let me waste my Anxiety in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had done with new Likings: and I had a more
easy Life perhaps on that account: <i>now</i> I shall often think
of you with uneasiness, for the very reason that I have so much 
Liking and Interest for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;the Sermon is done, Posh.&nbsp; You 
<i>know</i> I am not against Good Beer while at Work: nor a 
cheerful Glass after work: only do not let it spoil the stomach, 
or the Head.</p>

THE <i>MUM TUM</i></h2>
<p>FitzGerald having made up his mind to give Posh a lift by 
going into partnership with him began by finding not only the 
money for the building of the boat but a name for her when she 
should be ready for sea.&nbsp; It seemed to him that &ldquo;Meum 
and Tuum&rdquo; would be an appropriate name, and the <i>Mum 
Tum</i> is remembered along the coast to this day as a queer, 
meaningless title for a boat.&nbsp; At a later date FitzGerald is
reported to have said that his venture turned out all Tuum and no
Meum so far as he was concerned.&nbsp; But it is possible that 
Posh dealt more fairly with him than he thought.&nbsp; At all 
events Posh thinks he did.</p>
<p>The boat was to be paid for in instalments.&nbsp; <!-- page 
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>So 
much on laying the keel, so much when the deck was on, etc., 
etc., and FitzGerald took the greatest interest in her 
building.&nbsp; He had first thought of christening the lugger 
&ldquo;Marian Halcombe,&rdquo; after Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s 
heroine in <i>The Woman in White</i>, as appears from a letter to
Frederic Tennyson, written in January, 1867 (<i>Letters</i>, II, 
90, Eversley Edition):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I really think of having a Herring-lugger I
am building named Marian Halcombe. . . .&nbsp; Yes, a 
Herring-lugger; which is to pay for the money she costs unless 
she goes to the Bottom: and which meanwhile amuses me to consult 
about with my Sea-folks.&nbsp; I go to Lowestoft now and then by 
way of salutary Change; and there smoke a Pipe every night with a
delightful Chap who is to be Captain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again on June 17th (<i>Letters</i>, II, 94, Eversley Edition) 
he wrote to the late Professor Cowell of Corpus Christi College, 
Cambridge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>&ldquo;I am here in my little 
Ship&rdquo; (the <i>Scandal</i>) &ldquo;with no company but my 
crew&rdquo; (Tom Newson and his nephew Jack) &ldquo;. . . and my 
other&mdash;Captain of the Lugger now a-building: a Fellow I 
never tire of studying&mdash;If he <i>should</i> turn out knave, 
I shall have done with all Faith in my own Judgment: and if he 
should go to the Bottom of the Sea in the Lugger&mdash;I 
shan&rsquo;t cry for the Lugger.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was some delay in getting the deck planks on the lugger,
for FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding on May 18th, 1867 (<i>Two 
Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 110), that she would be decked 
&ldquo;next Week,&rdquo; whereas her planking was not finished 
till June, and, on a Friday in June, FitzGerald wrote to 
Posh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Friday</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Poshy</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only back To-day from London, where I had to go 
for two days: and I am very glad to be back.&nbsp; For the 
Weather <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>was wretched: the Streets all Slush: 
and I all alone wandering about in it.&nbsp; So as I was sitting 
at Night, in a great Room where a Crowd of People were eating 
Supper, and Singing going on, I thought to myself&mdash;Well, 
Posh might as well be here; and then I should see what a Face he 
would make at all this&mdash;This Thought really came into my 
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had asked Mr. Berry to forward me any Letters because
I thought you might write to say the Lugger was planked.&nbsp; 
But now you tell me it is no such thing: well, there is plenty of
time: but I wished not to delay in sending the Money, if 
wanted.&nbsp; I have seen, and heard, no more of Newson; nor of 
<i>his</i> new Lugger from Mr. Hunt&mdash;I am told that one of 
the American yachts, <i>The Henrietta</i>, is a perfect Model: so
I am going to have a Print of her that I may try and learn the 
Stem from the Stern of a Ship.&nbsp; If this North-Easter changes
I daresay I may run to Lowestoft next week <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and get a 
Sail, but it is too cold for that now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here is a letter, you see, my little small 
Captain, in answer to yours, which I was glad to see, for as I do
not forget you, as I have told you, so I am glad that you should 
sometime remember the Old Governor and Herring-merchant</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edward 
FitzGerald</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be observed that in this letter, as in several of 
those written to Posh, FitzGerald signed his name, &ldquo;Edward 
FitzGerald,&rdquo; in full, a practice from which he was averse 
owing to certain facts connected with another Edward 
Fitzgerald.&nbsp; Those who have heard the story of the historic 
first meeting between the poet and the late Mr. Bernard Quaritch 
will remember why <i>our</i> FitzGerald disliked the idea of 
being confused with the other Edward Fitzgerald.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The letter here given forces a delightful picture upon 
us.&nbsp; Its simplicity makes <!-- page 63--><a 
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>it superbly 
graphic.&nbsp; Think of FitzGerald, refined in feature and 
reserved in manner, a little unconventional in dress, but not 
sufficiently so to be vulgarly noticeable&mdash;think of the man 
who has given us the most poetical philosophy and the most 
philosophical poetry, all in the most exquisite English, in our 
language, sitting probably at Evans&rsquo;s (it sounds like 
Evans&rsquo;s with the suppers and the music) and looking a 
little pityingly at the reek about him like the &ldquo;poor old, 
solitary, and sad Man as he really was in spite of his 
Jokes&rdquo;; and then imaging in his mind&rsquo;s eye the 
handsome stalwart fisherman whom he loved so truly, and believing
that he was as morally excellent as he was physically!&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What a Face he would make at all this!&rdquo; thought the 
poet.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago a good friend of mine, the skipper of 
one of the most famous tugs of Yarmouth, had to go up to town on 
a salvage case before the Admiralty <!-- page 64--><a 
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Court.&nbsp; 
With him as witnesses went one or two beach men of the old 
school, wind-and sun-tanned old shell-backs, with voices like a 
fog-horn, and that entire lack of self-consciousness which is 
characteristic of simplicity and good breeding.&nbsp; My friend 
the skipper was cultured in comparison with the old beach men, 
and he was a little vexed when one old &ldquo;salwager&rdquo; 
insisted on accompanying him to the Oxford Music Hall.&nbsp; All 
went well till some conjurers appeared on the stage.&nbsp; Then 
the skipper found that he had made a mistake in edging away from 
the beach man.&nbsp; For that jolly old salt hailed him across 
the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi, Billeeoh!&nbsp; Bill Berry!&nbsp; Hi!
Lor, bor, howiver dew they dew&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Howiver dew they 
dew&rsquo;t, bor?&nbsp; Tha&rsquo;ss whoolly a masterpiece!&nbsp;
Hi!&nbsp; Billeeoh!&nbsp; Theer they goo agin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper always ends the story there.&nbsp; He is as brave 
a man as any on the coast.&nbsp; It was he who stood out in 
Yarmouth Roads all night to look for the Caistor life-boat <!-- 
page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>the night of the disaster&mdash;a night when the roads 
could not be distinguished from the shoals, so broken into 
tossing white horses was the whole offing&mdash;but I believe he 
slunk down the stairs of the Oxford that night, and left the old 
beach man still expressing his delighted wonder.</p>
<p>Perhaps FitzGerald thought that Posh would be as excited as 
the old beach man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Berry&rdquo; (as every one knows who knows anything
about FitzGerald) was the landlord of the house on Markethill, 
Woodbridge, where the poet lodged.&nbsp; (By the way, he was, so 
far as I know, no relation of my Bill Berry.)&nbsp; A sum of 
&pound;50 was due to Dan Fuller on the planking being completed, 
and FitzGerald was anxious to let Posh have the money as soon as 
it was needed.&nbsp; He &ldquo;remembered his debts&rdquo; even 
before they became due.</p>
<p>I have already stated that Hunt was a boat-builder at 
Aldeburgh, and that FitzGerald had, at first, wished Posh to 
employ <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>him to build the <i>Mum Tum</i>, as 
the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> was fated to be called.</p>
<p>The kindly jovial relations between the 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; and his partner could not be better 
indicated than by the name FitzGerald gives himself at the close,
just before he once more signs his name in full.&nbsp; Well, 
perhaps the legal luminary of Lowestoft would justify his inquiry
if Edward FitzGerald was the man who made a lot of money out of 
salt by saying, &ldquo;Well, he called himself a 
herring-merchant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolmaster who had never heard of either FitzGerald or 
Omar Khayy&aacute;m would (according to the nature of the breed) 
sniff and say &ldquo;What?&nbsp; A herring-merchant and a 
tent-maker!&nbsp; My boys are the sons of gentlemen.&nbsp; I 
can&rsquo;t be expected to know anything about tradesfolk of that
class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Posh has a sense of humour, and he says, &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; 
He used to laugh about that, the guv&rsquo;nor did.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;d catch hold o&rsquo; my jersey, so&rdquo; (here Posh 
pinches up a fold of <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>his blue woollen jersey), &ldquo;and 
say, &lsquo;Oh dear!&nbsp; Oh dear, Poshy!&nbsp; Two F&rsquo;s in
the firm.&nbsp; FitzGerald and Fletcher, herring 
salesmen&mdash;when Poshy catches any, which isn&rsquo;t as often
as it might be, you know, Poshy!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he&rsquo;d
laugh.&nbsp; Oh, he was a jolly kind-hearted man if ever there 
was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Posh&rsquo;s eyes will grow moist sometimes, I think 
perhaps with the thought that he might&mdash;ah, well!&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s too late now.</p>
<p>Posh wishes me to give the dimensions of the lugger, as she 
was of his own designing and proved a fast and stiff craft.&nbsp;
He had given her two feet less length than her beam called for, 
according to local ideas, and FitzGerald called her &ldquo;The 
Cart-horse,&rdquo; because she seemed broad and bluff for her 
length.&nbsp; She was forty-five feet in length, with a 
fifteen-foot beam and seven-foot depth.&nbsp; She was first 
rigged as a lugger, but altered to the more modern 
&ldquo;dandy&rdquo; (something like a ketch but with more rake 
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>to the mizzen and with no topmast on the mainmast) 
before she was sold.&nbsp; Any one about the herring basins who 
has arrived at fisherman&rsquo;s maturity (about sixty years) 
will remember the <i>Mum Tum</i>, and, so far as she was 
concerned, the partnership was entirely successful, for no one 
has a bad word to say for her.</p>
<h2><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>CHAPTER V<br />
&ldquo;NEIGHBOUR&rsquo;S FARE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It is impossible to arrive at the exact sum of money which 
FitzGerald brought into the partnership between him and Posh, but
it must have been something like five hundred pounds.&nbsp; The 
lugger cost &pound;360 to build, and, in addition, Posh was paid 
&pound;20 for his services (see <i>Letters</i>, p. 309), and 
various payments had to be made for &ldquo;sails, cables, warps, 
ballast, etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; Posh brought in what nets and gear he 
had, and his services.&nbsp; The first notion was that FitzGerald
should be owner of three-fourths of the concern; but on a 
valuation being made it was found that the nets and gear 
contributed by Posh were of greater value than had been supposed,
and before the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> put to sea it was understood 
that <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Posh should be half owner with his 
&ldquo;guvnor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Posh is very firm in his conviction 
that up to the return of the boat from her first cruise there had
been no mention of any bill of sale, or mortgage, of the boat and
gear to FitzGerald to secure the money he had found.&nbsp; 
According to him his partner was to be a sleeping partner and no 
more, and the entire conduct and control of the business were to 
be vested in Posh.&nbsp; The quarrels and misunderstandings which
subsequently arose on this point Posh attributes to certain 
&ldquo;interfarin&rsquo; parties&rdquo; (and especially to a 
Lowestoft lawyer), who were under the impression that FitzGerald 
had not looked after himself so well as he might have done and 
who thought that this omission should be remedied.&nbsp; Possibly
they had an idea that they might &ldquo;make 
somethin&rsquo;&rdquo; in the course of the remedial 
measures.</p>
<p>Early in August Posh sailed north with his crew to meet the 
herring on their way <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>down south.&nbsp; His luck was poor, 
and on August 26th FitzGerald wrote him from 
Lowestoft:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, <i>Monday</i>, <i>August</i> 
26.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we hear nothing of you, we suppose that you have yet
caught nothing worth putting in for.&nbsp; And, as I may be here 
only a Day longer, I write again to you: though I do not know if 
I have anything to say which needs writing again for.&nbsp; In my
former letter, directed to you as this letter will be, I desired 
you to get a Life Buoy as soon as you could.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is
for the Good of your People, as well as of yourself.&nbsp; What I
now have to say is wholly on your own Account: and that is, to 
beg you to take the Advice given by the Doctor to your Father: 
namely, <i>not</i> to drink <i>Beer</i> and <i>Ale</i> more than 
you can help: but only <i>Porter</i>, and, every day, some Gin 
and Water.&nbsp; I was talking to <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>your Father 
last Saturday; and I am convinced that you inherit a family 
complaint: if I had known of this a year ago I would not have 
drenched you with all the Scotch, and Norwich, Ale which I have 
given you. . . .&nbsp; Do not neglect this Advice, as being only 
an old Woman&rsquo;s Advice; you have, even at your early time of
life, suffered from <i>Gravel</i>; and you may depend upon it 
that Gravel will turn to <i>Stone</i>, unless you do something 
like what I tell you, and which the Doctor has told your 
Father.&nbsp; And I know that there is no Disease in the World 
which makes a young Man <i>old</i> sooner than Stone: No Disease 
that <i>wears</i> him more.&nbsp; You should take plenty of 
<i>Tea</i>; some Gin and Water every night; and <i>no</i> Ale, or
Beer; but only Porter; and not much of that.&nbsp; If you do not 
choose to buy Gin for yourself, buy some for <i>me</i>: and keep 
it on board: and drink some every Day, or Night.&nbsp; Pray 
remember this: and <i>do it</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>&ldquo;I have been here since I wrote my first Letter to
Scarboro&rsquo;; that is to say, a week ago.&nbsp; Till To-day I 
have been taking out some Friends every day: they leave the place
in a day or two, and I shall go home; though I dare say not for 
long.&nbsp; Your wife seems nearly right again; I saw her 
To-day.&nbsp; Your Father has engaged to sell his Shrimps to 
Levi, for this season and next, at 4s. a Peck.&nbsp; Your old 
<i>Gazelle</i> came in on Saturday with all her Nets gone to 
pieces; the Lugger <i>Monitor</i> came in here yesterday to alter
her Nets&mdash;from <i>Sunk</i> to <i>Swum</i>, I believe.&nbsp; 
So here is a Lowestoft Reporter for you: and you may never have 
it after all.&nbsp; But, if you do, do not forget what I have 
told you.&nbsp; Your Father thinks that you may have missed the 
Herring by going <i>outward</i>, where they were first caught: 
whereas the Herring had altered their course to inshore. . . 
.&nbsp; Better to miss many Herrings than have the Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>Here, again, the delicate solicitude of this perfect 
gentleman is apparent.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you do not choose to buy 
Gin for yourself, buy some for <i>me</i>: and keep it on board: 
and drink some every Day, or Night.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is to say, 
&ldquo;If you think that you cannot afford to buy gin for 
yourself don&rsquo;t worry about the expense.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
see you are not put to any extra cost.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t 
bear to think that you may suffer for the want of a medicine 
because of your East Anglian parsimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be remembered that East Anglia was notorious for the 
frequency of the disease in question.&nbsp; The late William 
Cadge, of Norwich, probably the finest lithotomist in the world 
(as Thompson was the greatest lithotritist), once told me that he
had performed over four hundred operations in the Norwich 
Hospital for this disease alone.</p>
<p>But FitzGerald&rsquo;s fears concerning Posh were not 
realised.&nbsp; He seems to have had an <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>especial 
dread of the disease (as who has not?), for in a letter to 
Frederic Tennyson of January 29th previously (II, 89, Eversley 
Edition) he wrote (of Montaigne): &ldquo;One of his Consolations 
for <i>The Stone</i> is that it makes one less unwilling to part 
with Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Levi was a Lowestoft fishmonger, referred to in the footnote 
of <i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 108.</p>
<p>The <i>Gazelle</i> was the &ldquo;punt&rdquo; or longshore 
boat which Posh bought at Southwold, and called (by reason of her
splendid qualities) <i>The Little Wonder</i>.</p>
<p>The difference between &ldquo;sunk&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;swum&rdquo; herring nets would be unintelligible to a 
modern herring fisher.&nbsp; Now the nets are thirty feet in 
depth, are buoyed on the surface of the sea, and are kept 
perpendicular (like a wall two miles long) by the weight of heavy
cables or &ldquo;warps&rdquo; which stretch along the bottom of 
the nets.&nbsp; I am, of course, referring to North Sea fishing 
only, and not to the longshore punts, <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>whose nets 
are not half the depth of the North Sea fleets.</p>
<p>In FitzGerald&rsquo;s time if the herring were expected to 
swim deep the nets were sunk <i>below</i> the cables or warps 
which strung them together, and if they were thought to be 
swimming high they were buoyed above the warps, the system of 
fishing being called &ldquo;sunk&rdquo; in the former case and 
&ldquo;swum&rdquo; in the latter.&nbsp; Now <i>all</i> nets are 
&ldquo;swum,&rdquo; that is to say, all are above the warps and 
are buoyed on the surface.&nbsp; But the depth has increased so 
much (to what is technically known as &ldquo;twenty-score 
mesh,&rdquo; which comes to about thirty feet) that there is no 
need to alter their setting.</p>
<p>Posh&rsquo;s wife, whose state of health is referred to in 
this letter, survived till 1892, but for many years suffered from
tuberculosis in the lungs.</p>
<p>The <i>Monitor</i> was a Kessingland craft, and belonged to 
one Hutton.</p>
<p>But whether Posh fished with &ldquo;sunk&rdquo; or <!-- page 
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>&ldquo;swum&rdquo; nets his luck was out for the season 
of 1867.&nbsp; The fish as a rule get down to the Norfolk coast 
about the beginning of October, and Posh had followed them down 
from Scarborough.&nbsp; About the end of September, or the 
beginning of October, FitzGerald wrote to his partner, addressing
the letter to 8 Strand Cottages, Lowestoft, in the expectation 
that the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> had come south with the rest of the
herring drifters, Yarmouth, Lowestoft, North and South Shields, 
and Scotch.</p>

of Herring landed in your market during this last week: the

keep the Fish in deep water, so that <i>swum</i> nets would 
scarce reach them yet.&nbsp; But this is mere guess.&nbsp; I told
you not to answer all my letters: but you can write me a line

</blockquote>
<p>Miss Green was the landlady of the house at 12 Marine Terrace,
Lowestoft, where FitzGerald usually stayed when he did not sleep 
aboard the <i>Scandal</i>.</p>
<p>Up to the date of the letter, and, indeed, throughout the 
season of 1867, the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> had bad luck.&nbsp; 
FitzGerald thought it was time that the luck should change, for 
&ldquo;Neighbour&rsquo;s fare&rdquo; is defined in <i>Sea Words 
and Phrases along the Suffolk Coast</i> as &ldquo;Doing as well 
as one&rsquo;s neighbours.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mayn&rsquo;t make a 
fortune, but I look for &ldquo;Neighbour&rsquo;s fare&rdquo; 
nevertheless.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

THE LUCK O&rsquo; THE <i>MUM TUM</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbour&rsquo;s fare&rdquo; was long in coming to 
FitzGerald in his venture as a &ldquo;herring 
merchant.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was happy enough in the 
consciousness that he was doing Posh a good turn.&nbsp; Whether 
or not Posh had a greater share of the earnings of the boat than 
he was entitled to I cannot say.&nbsp; Certainly he began to 
thrive exceedingly about this time, and, as an old longshoreman 
seven years Posh&rsquo;s senior, said to me the other day, 
&ldquo;He might ha&rsquo; been a gennleman!&nbsp; He used to kape
his greyhounds, and he had as pratty a mare as the&rsquo; wuz in 
Lowestoft.&nbsp; Ah! Mr. FitzGerald was a <i>good</i> gennleman 
to him&mdash;that he <i>wuz</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
81</span>Once again the epithet &ldquo;good,&rdquo; which he so 
pre-eminently merited.</p>
<p>But whether the year had been bad or good, it was necessary 
for the sleeping partner to look into the accounts of the 
firm.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day of 1867, when the season was over and all the
herring drifters had &ldquo;made up,&rdquo; that is to say, had 
worked out their accounts and struck a balance of profit or loss,
Fitzgerald wrote to Posh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Christmas Day</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Captain</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I hear from you to-morrow that <i>you</i> are 
coming over <i>here</i>, I shall most likely run over myself to 
Miss Green&rsquo;s at Lowestoft&mdash;by the Train which gets 
there about 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall look in upon you in the evening, if so be that 
I do not see you in the course of the day.&nbsp; I say I shall 
look in upon [<i>sic</i>] <i>to-morrow</i>, I dare 
say:&mdash;But, as this is <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Christmas 
time and I suppose you have many friends to see, I shall not want
you to be at school every evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Newson&rsquo;s piloting week, so he cannot 
come.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Posh did not go to Woodbridge, so FitzGerald went to Miss 
Green&rsquo;s, whence, on December the 28th, he wrote one of his 
most characteristic letters (in that it embraced interests so 
widely different) to Professor Cowell.&nbsp; The letter begins 
with a reference to M. Garcin de Tassy and his &ldquo;annual 
oration,&rdquo; and continues with some passages of great 
interest concerning the <i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i> and 
Attar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Dr. Aldis 
Wright&rsquo;s Eversley Edition of <i>Letters</i>, II, 
100.)&nbsp; Then from a delicate and dainty piece of criticism 
the poet turns to his herring business.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have come 
here to wind up accounts for our Herring-lugger: much against us 
as the season has been a bad one.&nbsp; My dear <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Captain 
[Posh], who looks in his Cottage like King Alfred in the Story, 
was rather saddened by all this, as he had prophesied better 
things.&nbsp; I tell him that if he is but what I think 
him&mdash;and surely my sixty years of considering men will not 
so deceive me at last!&mdash;I would rather lose money with him 
than gain it with others.&nbsp; Indeed I never proposed Gain, as 
you may imagine: but only to have some Interest with this dear 
Fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, he had his wish, though Posh maintains that there 
<i>was</i> gain in the business at a certain time to be referred 
to hereafter, and that there might have been plenty of gain but 
for the &ldquo;interfarin&rsquo; parties&rdquo; before 
mentioned.</p>
<p>From the first there was a difficulty in persuading Posh to 
keep any accounts of either outgoings or incomings.&nbsp; He 
seems to have paid a bill when he thought of it, or when he had 
the money for it handy.&nbsp; But no idea of book-keeping, even 
in its <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>most rudimentary form, was ever 
entertained by him.</p>
<p>And FitzGerald had, before ever the partnership was an 
accomplished fact, impressed on Posh the importance of 
remembering his debts.</p>
<p>Before the spring fishing began in 1868 the question of 
accounts came to the fore.&nbsp; On March the 29th the sleeping 
partner wrote from Woodbridge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Poshy</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your Letter of this Morning:&mdash;I suppose 
that you have got mine also.&nbsp; I hope that you understood 
what I said in it&mdash;about the Bills, I mean&mdash;that you 
should put down in writing <i>all</i> outgoings, and in such a 
way as you, or I, might easily reckon them up: I mean, so as to 
see what <i>each</i> amounts to&mdash;No man&rsquo;s Memory can 
be trusted in such matters; and I think that <i>your</i> Memory 
(jostled about, as you say, with many different calls, 
[<i>sic</i> no close to <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>parenthesis] needs to have 
<i>writing</i> to refer to.&nbsp; <i>Do not suppose for one 
moment</i> that I do not trust you, my good fellow: nor that I 
think you have made any great blunder in what Accounts you 
<i>did</i> keep last year.&nbsp; I only mean that a man ought to 
be able to point <i>out at once</i>, to himself or to others, all
the items of an Account; to do which, you know, gave you great 
Trouble&mdash;You must not be too proud to learn a little of some
one used to such business: <i>as Mr. Spalding</i>, for 
instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think the Oil and <i>Cutch</i> are as good, and 
as cheap, at Lowestoft as I can get them here, why not get them 
at once at Lowestoft?&nbsp; About that <i>green Paint</i> for the
Lugger&rsquo;s bottom:&mdash;Mr. Silver got some <i>so very 
good</i> for <i>Pasifull&rsquo;s</i> Smack last year that I think
it might be worth while to get some, if we could, from <i>his</i>
Merchant.&nbsp; You told me that what <i>you</i> got at Lowestoft
was <i>not</i> very good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>very glad</i> that the Lugger is so <!-- page 
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>well 
thought of that any one else wants to build from her.&nbsp; For 
she was <i>your</i> child, you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Durrant has never sent me the plants.&nbsp; I doubt
he must have lost some more children.&nbsp; Do not go to him 
again, if you went before.&nbsp; I daresay I shall be running 
over to Lowestoft soon.&nbsp; But I am not quite well.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember me to your Family: you do not tell me if your 
Mother is better.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mr. Spalding here referred to was at that time the manager
for a large firm of agricultural implement makers.&nbsp; 
Subsequently he became the curator of the museum at Colchester, 
and the letters from FitzGerald to him which were handed to Mr. 
Francis Hindes Groome formed the most valuable part of the second
part of <i>Two Suffolk Friends</i> called &ldquo;Edward 
FitzGerald.&nbsp; An Aftermath.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>&ldquo;Oil&rdquo; and &ldquo;cutch&rdquo; are 
preservatives for the herring nets.&nbsp; The oil is linseed, and
the nets are soaked in it before they are tanned by the 
cutch.&nbsp; Cutch is a dark resinous stuff, which is thrown into
a copper full of water and boiled till it is dissolved.&nbsp; 
Then the liquid is thrown over the nets and permitted to soak 
in.&nbsp; After the nets are soaked in linseed oil, and before 
they are tanned, they are hung up to dry in the open air.&nbsp; 
The process has to be repeated several times during each fishing,
and those who are familiar with Lowestoft and Yarmouth must also 
be familiar with the sight and smell of the nets, hanging out on 
railings, either on public open spaces or in private net 
yards.&nbsp; Where rails are not obtainable the nets are often 
spread on the ground, and an ingenious idea for the quaint shape 
of Yarmouth (unique with its narrow &ldquo;rows&rdquo;) is that 
the rows represent the narrow footpaths between the spaces on 
which the nets used to be laid to dry.</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>&ldquo;Pasifull&rdquo; is sometimes called 
&ldquo;Percival,&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;Pasifall,&rdquo; and 
sometimes as in this letter.&nbsp; His Christian name was Ablett,
and he was both a fisherman and a yacht hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Durrant was a market gardener and fruiterer in Lowestoft, 
and his sons carry on the same business in three shops in 
Lowestoft now.&nbsp; One of them remembers FitzGerald as a 
visitor and &ldquo;a queer old chap,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s all 
he knows about him.</p>
<p>I do not think Posh troubled himself much about the 
accounts.&nbsp; But there was another subject already broached 
which was to cause some unpleasantness between the partners.</p>
<p>Some of FitzGerald&rsquo;s friends, both at Lowestoft and 
elsewhere, had become uneasy at the hold which Posh had obtained 
over him.&nbsp; They feared lest he should become a baron of beef
at which Posh could cut and come again.&nbsp; More than one 
advised him that he should have some better <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>security than
a mere partnership understanding, that he should, in fact, insist
on having a bill of sale, or mortgage of the <i>Meum and Tuum</i>
and her gear to secure the money he had found.&nbsp; Possibly he 
was swayed by Posh&rsquo;s backwardness in the matter of 
account.&nbsp; Certainly he came to the conclusion that his 
friends were right, and that he should have a charge on the boat 
and her gear.&nbsp; Now I believe that Posh tells the truth when 
he says that in the first instance there was no mention of any 
such charge.&nbsp; And he was not a business man enough to see 
the reasonableness of FitzGerald&rsquo;s demand.&nbsp; He was, 
moreover, urged by the secretiveness of his race, the love of 
keeping private affairs from outsiders, and he bitterly resented 
the proposition.&nbsp; Indeed, during the early months of 1868, 
there were constant semi-quarrels, which were as constantly 
patched up.&nbsp; FitzGerald loved the man too well to quarrel 
with him definitely.&nbsp; Besides, Posh <!-- page 90--><a 
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>had not been 
well.&nbsp; In January FitzGerald wrote to Professor Cowell 
(<i>Letters</i>, II, 103, Eversley Edition): &ldquo;I have spent 
lots of money on my Herring-lugger, which has made but a poor 
season.&nbsp; So now we are going (like wise men) to lay out a 
lot more for Mackerel; and my Captain (a dear Fellow) is got ill,
which is the worst of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in this first instance Posh gave way.&nbsp; On April 14th 
FitzGerald wrote Mr. Spalding: &ldquo;I believe that he and I 
shall now sign the Mortgage Papers that make him owner of <i>Half
Meum and Tuum</i>.&nbsp; I only get out of him that he 
can&rsquo;t say he sees much amiss in the Deed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
Posh is still bitter about that deed, and still blames his old 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; for having listened to the 
&ldquo;interfarin&rsquo; parties.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not know 
what was the matter with him that spring.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was 
quare, sir,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what 
ta was.&nbsp; But I was quare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got well in time to go off after the spring mackerel, which
used to be a regular <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>fishing season off Lowestoft, though 
now mackerel are getting as scarce as salmon off the Norfolk and 
Suffolk coast.&nbsp; But the <i>Meum and Tuum&rsquo;s</i> bad 
luck still followed her with the longer and bigger meshed 
nets.&nbsp; On June 16th, 1868, FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding 
(<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 113):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mackerel still come in very slow, sometimes
none at all: the dead calm nights play the deuce with the 
Fishing, and I see no prospect of change in the weather till the 
Mackerel shall be changing their Quarters.&nbsp; I am vexed to 
see the Lugger come in Day after day so poorly stored after all 
the Labour and Time and Anxiety given to the work by her Crew; 
but I can do no more, and at any rate take my share of the Loss 
very lightly.&nbsp; I can afford it better than they can.&nbsp; I
have told Newson to set sail and run home any Day, Hour, or 
Minute, when he wishes to see his Wife and Family.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>Newson and Jack were down at Lowestoft with the 
<i>Scandal</i>, and it was characteristic of FitzGerald to give 
his skipper leave to run home when he wished.&nbsp; FitzGerald 
always liked the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> to be in harbour on a 
Sunday so that the men could see their wives and families and 
have a &ldquo;good hot dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&ldquo;FLAGSTONE FITZGERALD&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Now that the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> was ready for work 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s anxiety for the lives of her crew made him 
insist upon their taking life-belts aboard with them, although 
the mate had stated that no one would wear them.&nbsp; On April 
24th a letter was written to Posh from Woodbridge.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Poshy</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear from Mr. Birt this morning that the Life Belts 
were sent off to you yesterday&mdash;<i>directed to your 
house</i>.&nbsp; So I suppose they will reach you without your 
having to go look for them.&nbsp; But you can enquire at the Rail
if they don&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Birt says that he makes the Belts of <i>two</i> 
sizes for the Life Boat.&nbsp; But he has sent <i>all</i> yours 
of the large size, except one <!-- page 94--><a 
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>for the 
Boy.&nbsp; I had told him I thought you were all of you biggish 
Men, except the Boy.&nbsp; I suppose I have blundered as 
usual.&nbsp; But if the Jackets are too big you must change some 
of them.&nbsp; That will only cost carriage; and that I must pay 
for my Blunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt you have been unlucky in your drying 
days&mdash;yesterday we had such violent showers as would have 
washed out your oil, I think.&nbsp; And it must have rained much 
last night.&nbsp; But you share in <i>my</i> luck now, you 
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am very glad the children are better.&nbsp; I 
thought it was bad weather for fever.&nbsp; There has been great 
sickness here, I think.&nbsp; Mr. Gowing and his house are as 
tedious as Mr. Dove and <i>my</i> house; we must hope that does 
not mean to play as false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for your loss of lines and anchors.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>Mr. Gowing was, so far as Posh can recollect, a 
Woodbridge builder, and Mr. Dove was the Builder who altered 
Little Grange for FitzGerald.&nbsp; Whether or not the life-belts
fitted or were ever used I can&rsquo;t ascertain.&nbsp; But I 
believe that one was in existence a year or so ago.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;lines and anchors&rdquo; were, Posh thinks, lost from his 
old punt the <i>Gazelle</i>.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience I give a letter here which is 
somewhat out of date, but inasmuch as it has nothing to do with 
the fishing but only with the trust which FitzGerald had in Posh 
it may very well come in here.</p>

<p>The glass was, Posh assures me, a good one.&nbsp; But no one 
knows what became of it.&nbsp; Later FitzGerald again mentions 
the glass.</p>

<p>As soon as I asked Posh the meaning of the signature 
&ldquo;Flagstone FitzGerald&rdquo; he burst out laughing.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t yew niver 
heard about ole Flagstone?&nbsp; He was a retail and wholesale 
grocer and gin&rsquo;ral store dealer at Yarmouth name ---&rdquo;
(well, we will say Smith for purposes of reference.&nbsp; As the

<p>And it isn&rsquo;t a bad yarn for one which is actually true 
in every respect.</p>
<p>About the same time, or a little later (for it is impossible 
to fix the date of these letters definitely), Fitzgerald 
wrote:&mdash;</p>

HOW FISHERS FISHED</h2>
<p>The poor mackerel season ended in the second week of 
July.&nbsp; Why, when mackerel were so scarce, the <i>Meum and 
Tuum</i> did not give up the fishing and try for &ldquo;midsummer
herring&rdquo; it is difficult to understand, and Posh does not 
remember the reason, if there was one.&nbsp; Possibly the change 
of nets, etc., etc., was too much trouble.&nbsp; Anyhow, the 
season was unprofitable for the mackerel boats.&nbsp; On Monday, 
July 13th, FitzGerald was still on the <i>Scandal</i> at 
Lowestoft, and wrote from there to Mr. Spalding (<i>Two Suffolk 
Friends</i>, p. 113): &ldquo;Posh made up and paid off on 
Saturday.&nbsp; I have not yet asked him, but I suppose he has 
just paid his way, I mean so far as Grub goes. . . .&nbsp; Last 
night it <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>lightened to the South, as we sat in
the Suffolk Gardens&mdash;I, and Posh, and Mrs. Posh. . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;making up&rdquo; may require some little 
explanation.&nbsp; The &ldquo;drift&rdquo; fishing&mdash;i.e. the
herring and mackerel fishing (for though sprats and pilchards are
caught by drift nets, it is unnecessary to consider them when 
dealing with the great North Sea drift fishing)&mdash;is carried 
on on a system of sharing profits between owners and 
fishermen.&nbsp; Trawlers, i.e. craft that fish with a 
&ldquo;trawl&rdquo; net for flat fish, haddocks, etc., etc., are 
managed differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making up&rdquo; is the technical term for balancing 
profit and loss of a season, and ascertaining the sums which are 
due to owners and crew respectively.</p>
<p>In the days when Fitzgerald was a &ldquo;herring 
merchant,&rdquo; the systems of Yarmouth and Lowestoft were 
different.&nbsp; At Yarmouth the owner of the boat took nine 
shares out of sixteen, and bore all losses of <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>damaged or 
lost nets, etc., the remaining seven shares being divided among 
the crew in varying proportions.&nbsp; For instance, the skipper 
took 1&frac34; or two shares, the mate 1&frac14; or 1&frac12;, 
and so on down to the boy with his one-half or three-eighths 
share.&nbsp; At Lowestoft the shares were also divided into 
sixteen; but the owner took only eight, and the crew the other 
eight.&nbsp; The losses of gear, nets, etc., however, were borne 
equally between the two lots of eight shares, and, on the whole, 
I believe the Yarmouth system was more favourable to the men, 
though the Lowestoft system made the skipper and crew more 
careful of the nets and gear than they might have been did not 
they suffer for any loss of them.&nbsp; The introduction of steam
drifters has made the shares complicated in the extreme.&nbsp; 
The owners take so much as owners of the boat, so much for the 
engines, etc., etc., and, in fact, the owners get the share of a 
very greedy lion.&nbsp; However, the prices rule so high 
nowadays, <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and the catches are occasionally so 
large (the other day a steam drifter brought in over &pound;200 
worth of fish to Grimsby as the result of one night&rsquo;s 
fishing), that the great Martinmas fishing of the east coast has 
become a gamble in which fortunes may be made and lost.&nbsp; 
Many a boat earns over &pound;2000 from October to 
December.&nbsp; A lucky skipper may take &pound;200 for his share
of the home fishing alone.&nbsp; But such figures would have 
sounded fantastic in FitzGerald&rsquo;s day, for I have been 
assured over and over again by herring fishers that in the 
sixties and seventies, ay, even in the eighties of last century, 
&pound;20 was a &ldquo;good season&rsquo;s share&rdquo; for a 
prominent hand of a successful drifter.</p>
<p>Posh, as half owner, would take four-sixteenth shares, and as 
skipper would probably take another two-sixteenths, so that he 
would draw more than any one else.</p>
<p>Some time during the spring or summer of 1868 there was great 
excitement amongst the fishing-boat owners of Lowestoft <!-- page
104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
104</span>and other ports on account of an Act just passed 
regulating the building of vessels, having especial regard to the
ventilation of the cuddy, forecastle, or the men&rsquo;s sleeping
quarters.&nbsp; Posh tells me that many owners of drifters 
considered that the Act applied to all craft, including fishing 
boats, and that great expense was undergone by some 
over-conscientious owners in fitting ventilating drums and shafts
in accordance with the Act.&nbsp; If the statute applied to any 
drifter it would apply to the <i>Meum and Tuum</i>, and 
FitzGerald evidently thought that the intention of the Act was 
that fishing boats should be exempt.&nbsp; He proved to be right,
for the regulations were never enforced on fishing boats.&nbsp; 
He wrote to Posh:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Saturday</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must lay out three halfpence on the <i>Eastern 
Times</i> for last Friday.&nbsp; In that Newspaper there is a 
good deal written <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>about that Act for altering Vessels:
the Writer is quite sure&mdash;that the Act does <i>not</i> apply
to Fishing craft; and he writes as if he knew what he was writing
about.&nbsp; But most likely if he had written just the contrary,
it would have seemed as right to me.&nbsp; Do you therefore fork 
out three halfpennies, as I tell you, and study the matter and 
talk it over with others.&nbsp; The owners of Vessels should lose
no time in meeting, and in passing some Resolution on the 
Subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen Newson, but West was down at the Ferry 
some days back and saw him.&nbsp; For a wonder, he [Newson] was 
<i>Fishing</i>!&mdash;for Codlings&mdash;for there really was 
nothing else to do: no Woodbridge Vessels coming in and out the 
Harbour, nor any work for the Salvage Smacks.&nbsp; He spoke of 
his Wife as much the same: Smith, the Pilot, thought her much 
altered when last he saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will buy such things as you spoke <!-- page 
106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>of
wanting at the Lowestoft Sales if they go at a reasonable 
price.&nbsp; As to the claim made by your Yawl, I suppose it will
come down to half.&nbsp; The builders are coming to my house 
again next week, I believe, having left their work undone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, here is a Letter for your Mantelpiece 
to-morrow&mdash;Sunday&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I have more to

<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours E. FG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Durrant has never sent me the hamper of Flowers he 
promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; I post this letter before Noon so as you 
will receive it this evening: and can get the Newspaper I tell 
you of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eastern Times</i> for <i>Friday</i> last sold at 
Chapman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Posh does not remember whether he laid out the three halfpence
or not.&nbsp; But he doubts it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knowed as that 
couldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; ta dew along o&rsquo; 
us,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; And he stuck to his guns and proved to 
be right.</p>

an old fellow with whom FitzGerald used to navigate the river 
Deben in a small boat before the building of the 
<i>Scandal</i>.&nbsp; Newson&rsquo;s wife, like Posh&rsquo;s, was
often ailing.&nbsp; Kind &ldquo;Fitz&rdquo; had written 
previously (July 25th, 1868; <i>Letters</i>, Eversley Edition, p.
106) to Professor Cowell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . I only left Lowestoft partly to avoid
a Volunteer Camp there which filled the Town and People with 
Bustle: and partly that my Captain might see his Wife: who cannot
last very much longer I think: scarcely through the Autumn, 
surely.&nbsp; She goes about, nurses her children, etc., but 
grows visibly thinner, weaker and more ailing.&rdquo;</p>

<img alt="The &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; yawl, belonging to 
Posh&rsquo;s beach company" src="images/p107.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;claim made by your yawl&rdquo; refers to a claim 
for salvage made by the company of beach men (of which Posh was a
member) owning a yawl.&nbsp; FitzGerald (as has been seen before)
always took a humorous interest <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>in the 
doings of the &ldquo;sea pirates,&rdquo; yclept beach men or 
&ldquo;salwagers,&rdquo; and he doubtless enjoyed his little 
chuckle at Posh&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>The builders were at work on Little Grange, which FitzGerald 
predicted he would never live in but would die in.&nbsp; However,
he falsified both predictions, for he lived in the house ten 
years and died in Norfolk.</p>
<p>Mr. Durrant was still in default.&nbsp; I doubt if FitzGerald 
ever got those flowers.&nbsp; They were plants, Posh tells me, 
which FitzGerald wished to plant out at Little Grange.</p>
<p>I can find no record of the principal, the Martinmas or 
Autumn, fishing of 1868.&nbsp; But in the spring of 1869 the 
<i>Meum and Tuum</i> went to the &ldquo;West Fishing&rdquo; for 
mackerel, even as a large number of our modern steam drifters go 
now, to the indignation of the pious fishermen of Penzance, 
Newlyn, and St. Ives.&nbsp; These good fellows <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>of the west
have, I think, some reason to complain that it is unfair that 
they should suffer for righteousness&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; Looking 
at the point in dispute impartially, it <i>does</i> seem hard 
that the men of the locality should see Easterlings bringing in 
good catches of fish as the result of what the Cornishmen regard 
as a desecration of &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
religious sentiment which prevents the western and southern men 
from putting off on Sunday is genuine and sincere enough.&nbsp; 
The Scotch herring boats, which come in their thousands to 
Yarmouth and Lowestoft for the autumn fishing, are always in 
harbour from Saturday night to Monday morning, though the local 
boats fish all days and nights.&nbsp; But by keeping in harbour 
the Scotchmen offend the sensibilities of no one, whereas there 
is much bitterness caused in the west by the refusal of the 
Easterlings to fall in with local custom.</p>
<p>On March 1st, 1869, FitzGerald wrote to <!-- page 110--><a 
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Professor 
Cowell (<i>Letters</i>, II, 107, Eversley Edition):&mdash;</p>

I shall see him again. . . .&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t think what a 
grand, tender Soul this is, lodged in a suitable 
carcase.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FitzGerald thought very highly of that &ldquo;carcase&rdquo; 
of Posh&rsquo;s, as will be seen from the story of the Laurence 
portrait, set forth hereinafter, as the lawyers, whom Posh hates 
so much, would say.</p>
<p>The sleeping partner throughout seems to have had more anxiety
on account of Posh&rsquo;s sea hazards than on account of 
business losses.&nbsp; How the mackerel paid I do not know, but 
Posh was in time to go north for the beginning of the herring 
fishing in July.</p>

ECCENTRICITIES OF A GOOD HEART</h2>
<p>There must always be an interval ashore between the return of 
the drifters from the western voyage and their sailing north to 
follow the herring down from Aberdeen to Yarmouth.&nbsp; And 
during this interval, in 1869, FitzGerald wrote one or two 
letters to Posh which have survived that wholesale destruction of
which their recipient speaks.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Friday</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newson is up here with the Yacht, Posh; and we shall 
start to-morrow with the Tide about 10&frac12;.&nbsp; I doubt if 
we shall get out of the harbour: or, even if we do that, get to 
Lowestoft in the Day.&nbsp; But you can just give a look to the 
Southward <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span

I write this, because we <i>may</i> not have more than a day to 
stay at Lowestoft.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite his silk hat and his boa, FitzGerald was a keen and 
genuine lover of yachting.&nbsp; Even in the way in which he took
his enjoyment of this he was original.&nbsp; Posh asserts that he
has seen his &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; lying in the lee 
scuppers while the <i>Scandal</i> was heeling over in a stiff 
breeze, and permitting the wash of the sea to run over him till 
he was drenched to the skin.&nbsp; Indeed, although his long lean
body looked frail, he was reckless in the way in which he treated
it.&nbsp; Posh tells one story which I give in his words.&nbsp; 
He vouches for its truth, and I give it on his authority and not 
as vouching for its accuracy myself.&nbsp; Personally I believe 
the tale is true enough, but I admit that it requires a power of 
assimilation which is not given to all.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span

Posh.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a rum un sometimes, was my 
guv&rsquo;nor!&nbsp; I remember one day when the <i>Scandal</i> 
was a layin&rsquo; agin&rsquo; the wharf where the trawl market 
is now.&nbsp; Mr. Sims Reeves, the lawyer [this was a prominent 
counsel on the Norwich circuit, not the famous tenor], and some 
other friends came over for a sail, and they and Tom [Newson] was
below while me and Jack and the guv&rsquo;nor was on deck, 
astarn.&nbsp; The mains&rsquo;l was h&rsquo;isted, but there 
wasn&rsquo;t no heads&rsquo;l on her, and we lay theer riddy to 
get unner way.&nbsp; There was a fresh o&rsquo; wind

theer the boom kep&rsquo; a wamblin&rsquo; and a jerkin&rsquo; 
from side to side, a wrenchin&rsquo; the mainsheet block a rum

had just been brought down by the poost.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Posh,&rsquo; he say, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a letter with

<p>The northern herring voyage of the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> in 
1869, that is to say, the eight weeks&rsquo; fishing down the 
east coast from Aberdeen to Lowestoft from the beginning of 
August to the end of September, seems to have been about up to 
what FitzGerald might have called &ldquo;Neighbour&rsquo;s 
fare.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote to Mrs. W. H. Thompson (the wife of 
the Master of Trinity): &ldquo;My lugger has had (along with her 
neighbours) such a Season hitherto of Winds as no one 
remembers.&nbsp; We made &pound;450 in the North Sea&rdquo; (that
is to say, in the north fishing before the home Martinmas fishing
began); &ldquo;and (just for fun) I did wish to realise &pound;5 
in my pocket.&nbsp; But my Captain would take it all to pay 
Bills.&nbsp; But if he makes another &pound;400 this Home <!--

pockets.&nbsp; I do wish this.&nbsp; For the anxiety about all 
these people&rsquo;s lives has been so much more to me than all 
the amusement I have got from the Business, that I think I will 
draw out of it if I can see my Captain sufficiently firm on his 
legs to carry it on alone.&nbsp; True, there will still be the 
same risk to him and his ten men, but they don&rsquo;t care; only
I sit here listening to the Winds in the Chimney, and always 
thinking of the eleven hanging at my own finger ends&rdquo;

<p>The number of hands on a herring drifter used to be eleven, 
which seemed excessive till the labour of hauling nearly two 
miles of nets by hand is remembered.&nbsp; Now that almost every 
drifter which goes into the North Sea has a donkey engine to do 
the hardest work of the hauling the number aboard the dandies is 
lessened to nine.</p>
<p>This letter to Mrs. Thompson is the first <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>suggestion 
that FitzGerald has any idea of ending the partnership, a 
suggestion which became fully developed in 1870.</p>
<p>But before Posh was hard at it every day, fishing off the 
Norfolk coast, his &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; wrote him a note 
in a much more cheerful strain.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a letter by
itself, unlike any other of the writer&rsquo;s which I have seen,
though (as Dr. Aldis Wright says) &ldquo;FitzGerald never wrote a
letter like any one else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The power of throwing 
himself &ldquo;into the picture,&rdquo; the humour of conscious 
imitation, were never more brilliantly illustrated than by this 
hail-fellow-well-met letter, written by the scholar and 
poet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Markethill</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Wednesday</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Posh, here is a letter for you, sooner than 
you looked for, and moreover you will have to answer it as soon 
as you can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to learn from your friend <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span><i>Dan 
Fuller</i> what particulars you can about that Lugger we saw at 
Mutford Bridge.&nbsp; Draft of Water, Length of Keel, What sails 
and Stores; and what <i>Price</i>; and any other Questions you 
may think necessary to ask.&nbsp; If the man here who has a 
notion of buying such a Vessel to make a Yacht of on this river 
sees any hope of doing so at a reasonable rate, and with a 
reasonable hope of Success, he will go over next week to look at 
the Vessel.&nbsp; He of course knows he would have to alter all 
her inside: but I told him your Opinion that she would do well 
<i>cutter rigged</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now, Poshy, do go down as soon as is convenient, to 
Dan, and stand him <i>half a pint</i> and don&rsquo;t tell him 
what you are come about, but just turn the conversation (in a 
<i>Salvaging</i> sort of way) to the old Lugger and get me the 
particulars I ask for.&nbsp; Perhaps Dan&rsquo;s heart will 
open&mdash;<i>over Half a Pint</i>&mdash;as yours has been known 
to do.&nbsp; And if you write to me as soon as you can <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>what you can learn, why I take my Blessed Oath that 
I&rsquo;ll be d---d if I don&rsquo;t stand you Half a Pint, so 
help me Bob, the next time I go to Lowestoft.&nbsp; I hope I make
myself understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Elsie</i> is being gutted, and new timbered, and
Mr. Silver has bought a new dandy of forty tons, and Ablett 
Percival&rdquo; (cf. spelling in other letters) &ldquo;is to be 
Captain.&nbsp; I think of going down the river soon to see 
Captain Newson.&nbsp; I have been on the River To-day and thought
that I should have been with you on the way to Yarmouth or 
Southwold if I had stayed at Lowestoft.&nbsp; Instead of which I 
have been to the Lawyer here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Poshy, and believe me always yours to the 
last Half Pint.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enclose a paper with my questions marked, to which 
you can add short answers.&rdquo;</p>

Tuum</i>.&nbsp; His son is still living, and a well-known 
mechanic in Lowestoft.&nbsp; Mutford Bridge will be better 
recognised as the bridge at Oulton Broad.</p>
<p>Once again FitzGerald chuckles at the morality of the 
&ldquo;salwagers,&rdquo; and chuckles again at the expansiveness 
of the East Anglian &ldquo;half a pint,&rdquo; which may mean 
anything between its nominal measure and the full holding 
capacity of the drinker&mdash;which is as vague as &ldquo;half a 
pint,&rdquo; itself.</p>
<p>The <i>Elsie</i> was a yacht which belonged to a syndicate of 
Woodbridge yachtsmen, of whom Mr. Silver (a Woodbridge friend of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s) was one and Mr. Manby was another.&nbsp; The 
two friends who went to Mutford Bridge to look at the lugger were
(so far as Posh can remember) Mr. Silver and Mr. Cobbold, of 
Cobbold&rsquo;s Bank.&nbsp; Posh says that the lugger was a 
beauty.&nbsp; But nothing came of the visit, and the Woodbridge 
man did not buy her.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>As yet the warning which FitzGerald had given Posh in 
his sermon had (so far as the letters tell us) served its 
purpose.&nbsp; But the letters appear to be deceitful in this,

partnership.</p>

POSH&rsquo;S SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE</h2>
<p>The hopes for the home fishing of 1869 should have been 
good.&nbsp; On August 30th, 1869 (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 
114), FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding from Lowestoft: &ldquo;You
will see by the enclosed that Posh has had a little better luck 
than hitherto.&nbsp; One reason for my not going to Woodbridge 
is, that I think it possible that this N.E. wind may blow him 
hither to tan his nets.&nbsp; Only please God it don&rsquo;t tan 
him and his people first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herring are, as our East Anglian fishermen say, 
&ldquo;ondependable&rdquo; in their travels.&nbsp; They come 
south along the coast from the <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>north of 
Scotland till they are in their prime (full-roed, fat fish) off 
Yarmouth in October.&nbsp; But their arrival at the various ports
along the east coast can never be fixed for a certain date.&nbsp;
This year, for instance (1907), owing to the warm August and 
September they have been late in coming south from Hull.&nbsp; 
Generally &ldquo;longshores&rdquo; are caught off Lowestoft late 
in August or early in September, and by the end of September the 
home and Scotch fleets are congesting the herring basins.&nbsp; 
This year, however, I had my first longshores brought me 
yesterday, the 1st of October, and there are not a dozen Scotch 
craft to be seen in the basins.</p>
<p>FitzGerald stayed at Lowestoft till the north-easters 
<i>did</i> blow Posh home.&nbsp; And perhaps he would have been 
happier had he gone back to Woodbridge before the return of the 
<i>Meum and Tuum</i>.&nbsp; As it was, Posh had &ldquo;some 
bare&rdquo; on regatta day (very late that year), and this upset 
his &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 124--><a 
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>He wrote to
Mr. Spalding on the 4th September (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p.
115): &ldquo;I would not meddle with the Regatta. . . .&nbsp; And
the Day ended by vexing me more than it did him [Newson]. . . 
.&nbsp; Posh drove in here the day before to tan his nets: could 
not help making one with some old friends in a Boat-race on the 
Monday, and getting very fuddled with them on the Suffolk Green 
(where I was) at night.&nbsp; After all the pains I have taken, 
and all the real anxiety I have had.&nbsp; And worst of all after
the repeated promises he had made!&nbsp; I said there must be an 
end of Confidence between us, so far as <i>that</i> was 
concerned, and I would so far trouble myself about him no 
more.&nbsp; But when I came to reflect that this was but an 
outbreak among old friends, on an old occasion, after (I do 
believe) months of sobriety; that there was no concealment about 
it; and that though obstinate at first as to how little drunk, 
etc., he was very repentant <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
125</span>afterwards&mdash;I cannot let this one flaw weigh 
against the general good of the man.&nbsp; I cannot if I would: 
what then is the use of trying?&nbsp; But my confidence in that 
respect must be so far shaken, and it vexes me to think that I 
can never be sure of his not being overtaken so.&nbsp; I declare 
that it makes me feel ashamed very much to play the judge on one 
who stands immeasurably above me in the scale, whose faults are 
better than so many virtues.&nbsp; Was not this very outbreak 
that of a great genial Boy among his old Fellows?&nbsp; True, a 
Promise was broken.&nbsp; Yes, but if the Whole Man be of the 
Royal Blood of Humanity, and do Justice in the Main, what are 
<i>the people</i> to say?&nbsp; <i>He</i> thought, if he thought 
at all, that he kept his promise in the main.&nbsp; But there is 
no use talking, unless I part company wholly, I suppose I must 
take the evil with the good. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>FitzGerald probably got to the very heart of the 
misunderstanding between himself <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and Posh as
to the merits and demerits of &ldquo;bare&rdquo; when he wrote 
that Posh was a little obstinate as to &ldquo;how little 
drunk,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Moreover he understood the nature of the
man&mdash;&ldquo;a great genial boy&rdquo;&mdash;but he did not 
understand that these &ldquo;great genial boys&rdquo; have all 
the mischievous tendencies, and all the irresponsibility of real 
boys.&nbsp; He was kind and forbearing enough, God knows.&nbsp; 
But he had set up his Posh on such a pinnacle of pre-eminence 
over all his fellow-men that it is possible that his bitterness 
in discovering that after all his prot&eacute;g&eacute; was 
merely a well-built, handsome, ordinary longshoreman caused a 
greater revulsion than would have occurred had his first estimate
of Posh&rsquo;s character been less exalted.</p>
<p>It is to the credit of the great heart of the man that he 
never lost his love of Posh (Posh is certain about this), though 
he undoubtedly did lose his confidence in and respect for 
him.</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>And Posh did not give way to his 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; as he might have done.&nbsp; That 
fine old East Anglian spirit of independence (which is so 
generally admirable) was in this particular instance sheer brutal
ingratitude when shown by Posh to FitzGerald.&nbsp; No one has a 
greater admiration than I for this magnificent claim of a <span 
class="smcap">Man</span> to be <span 
class="smcap">Man&rsquo;s</span> equal.&nbsp; It kept the race of
Norfolk and Suffolk longshoremen worthy of their traditions until
the cockney visitors, with their tips and their hunger for 
longshore lies, ruined the nature of many of our beach 
folk.&nbsp; But with FitzGerald, that kind, solicitous gentleman 
who never asserted the claims of his station in life before an 
inferior, the obtrusive display of this spirit of independence 
was as unnecessary as it was cruel.&nbsp; And I think Posh 
understands this now.&nbsp; He certainly never meant to hurt the 
feelings of his old governor.&nbsp; But he chafed at the care 
which his friend took of him.&nbsp; He said to me the other day 
that he wished his <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>old master were alive now to take 
such care.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d 
take hold o&rsquo; me like this here&rdquo; (and here, as I have 
described on a previous page, Posh pinched up his blue knitted 
jersey), &ldquo;and say, &lsquo;Oh, my dear Poshy!&nbsp; Oh 
dear!&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; To think you should be like 
this!&nbsp; Oh dear!&nbsp; Oh dear!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Posh&rsquo;s old eyes will water.&nbsp; Indeed, I have 
noticed a likeness between the thoughts of Posh in reference to 
FitzGerald and the remorse of the son of a loving father who had 
tried his sire hard in lifetime and understood that he had done 
so after his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Even now, this old man 
of sixty-nine leans, metaphorically, on the recollection of the 
man who loved him so.&nbsp; Even now he says, &ldquo;Ah! that 
would ha&rsquo; upset him if he&rsquo;d known I should ha&rsquo; 
come to this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in 1869 Posh thought that he was a very fine fellow 
indeed, and was not going to be &ldquo;put upon&rdquo; by any 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; no matter <!-- page 129--><a 
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>how kind 
the &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; had been to him.&nbsp; He was 
half owner of a fine drifter and skipper as well, to say nothing 
of having designed the boat.&nbsp; He would assert himself.</p>
<p>He did.</p>

POSH SHOWS TEMPER</h2>
<p>Posh says that there &ldquo;were lots o&rsquo; breezes&rdquo; 
between him and his &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; and when the 
reader of this study (who should have got to know something of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s attitude by now) realises this he will be able
to appreciate the long-suffering generosity of this cultured 
scholar whom fools have painted as a mere eccentric hermit.&nbsp;
Posh, now that he was well started by the aid of his governor, 
began to yearn for independence.&nbsp; Possibly he had some 
reason to complain that his sleeping partner interfered in 
matters of which he was ignorant.&nbsp; On September 21st, 1869, 
FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 
118):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Posh came up with his Lugger last <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
131</span>Friday, with a lot of torn nets, and went off again on 
Sunday.&nbsp; I thought he was wrong to come up, and not to 
transmit his nets by Rail, as is often done at 6d. a net.&nbsp; 
But I did not say so to him&mdash;it is no unamiable point in him
to love <i>home</i>: but I think he won&rsquo;t make a fortune by
it.&nbsp; However, I may be very wrong in thinking he had better 
<i>not</i> have come.&nbsp; He has made about the average 
fishing, I believe: about &pound;250.&nbsp; Some boats have 
&pound;600, I hear; and some few not enough to pay their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came up with a very bad cold and hoarseness; and so 
went off, poor fellow: he never will be long well, I do 
think.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably Posh knew all about the best way of making a profit 
out of herring drifters, and FitzGerald may have been wrong in 
fearing that he did not.&nbsp; FitzGerald, with his superb 
culture, may not (I do not say he did not) have understood that 
Posh, on his native North Sea, may <!-- page 132--><a 
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>have been 
more than a match for all the culture in the world.&nbsp; For 
what I know of the old longshoreman, I am convinced that if he 
brought his nets home in his lugger he did so because he thought 
it was the most profitable way of bringing them back.&nbsp; But 
FitzGerald grew anxious, and his anxiety was not understood by 
the natural child of the beach, and caused friction and mutual 
irritation.</p>
<p>But this did not break out till the north voyage was over and 
the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> had been on the home fishing for more 
than a month.&nbsp; Then Posh began to have the fingering of a 
good deal of money, and FitzGerald had already had reason to 
doubt his abilities to keep his credit and debit sides of account
in proper order.&nbsp; Moreover, the usual autumn gales had been 
bringing the stormy and dark nights which are as profitable as 
they are dangerous to the drifters.&nbsp; On Monday, November 
1st, 1869 (one of the few letters of FitzGerald&rsquo;s <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>which I have seen completely dated), the sleeping 
partner wrote on a sheet of paper headed by a monogram which is 
&ldquo;S.W. &amp; B.&rdquo; so far as I can make out.&nbsp; To 
make up for the fullness of the date there is no address.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot lay blame to myself, Posh, in this
matter, though I may not have known you were so busy with the 
boat as you tell me.&nbsp; Hearing of great disasters by last 
week&rsquo;s gale, I was, as usual, anxious about you.&nbsp; 
Hearing nothing from you, I telegram&rsquo;d on Thursday 
Afternoon to Mr. Bradbeer: his answer reached me at 5 p.m. that 
you had come in on Tuesday, and were then safe in harbour.&nbsp; 
Being then afraid lest you should put off paying away the money, 
which, as I told you, was a positive <i>danger</i> to Wife and 
Children, I directly telegram&rsquo;d to <i>you</i> to do what I 
had desired you to do the week before.&nbsp; Busy as you were, 
five minutes spent in writing me a <!-- page 134--><a 
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>line would 
have spared all this trouble and all this vexation on both 
sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to my telegrams telling all the world what you wish 
to keep secret; how did they do that?&nbsp; My telegrams to Mr. 
Bradbeer were simply to ask if you were <i>safe</i>.&nbsp; My 
telegram to you was simply to say, &lsquo;Do what I bid 
you&rsquo;; Who should know <i>what</i> that was, or that it had 
anything to do with paying the Boat&rsquo;s Bills?&nbsp; People 
might guess it had <i>something</i> to do with the Boat: and 
don&rsquo;t you suppose that every one knows pretty well how 
things are between us?&nbsp; And why should they not, I say, when
all is honestly done between us?&nbsp; The Custom House people 
must know (and, of course, tell others) that you are at present 
only Half-owner; and would suppose that <i>I</i>, the other Half,
would use some Authority in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say truly that, when we began together, you 
supposed I should leave all to you, and use <i>no</i> Authority 
(though you <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>have always asked me about anything 
you wished done).&nbsp; Quite true.&nbsp; I never did wish to 
meddle; nor did I call on you for any Account, till I saw last 
year that you forgot a really important sum, and that you did not
seem inclined to help your Memory (as every one else does) by 
writing it down in a Book.&nbsp; In two cases this year I have 
shown you the same forgetfulness (about your liabilities I mean) 
and I do not think I have been unjust, or unkind, in trying to 
make you bring <i>yourself</i> to Account.&nbsp; You know, and 
ought to believe, that I have perfect confidence in <i>your 
honour</i>; and have told you of the one defect I observed in you
as much for your sake as mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quite as much</i>, yes!&nbsp; For the anxiety I have
. . . [word illegible] [? suffered] these two years about your 
eleven lives is but ill compensated by all these squalls between 
us two; which I declare I excuse myself of raising.&nbsp; If, in 
this last case, you really had not time to post me a line or two 
to <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>say you were all safe, and that you had done what I 
desired you to do; I am very sorry for having written so sharply 
as I did to you: but I cannot <i>blame</i> myself for the 
mistake.&nbsp; No: this I will say: I am not apt to think too 
much of my doings, and dealings with others.&nbsp; But, in my 
whole sixty years, I can with a clear conscience say that I have 
dealt with <i>one man</i> fairly, kindly, and not ungenerously, 
for three good years.&nbsp; I may have made mistakes; but I can 
say I have done <i>my</i> best as conscientiously as he can say 
he has done his.&nbsp; And I believe he <i>has</i> done his best,
though he has also made mistakes; and I remain his sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bradbeer was a herring merchant, and his family is still 
prominent in the fishing industry of Lowestoft.&nbsp; 
Posh&rsquo;s letter, to which the above is a reply, must have 
been very characteristic of his race, to which secrecy concerning
their private <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>affairs is a first nature.&nbsp; The
mistrust of the privacy of the &ldquo;telegrams&rdquo; may 
possibly have had some justification.&nbsp; Even in these days 
there are East Anglian villages where the contents of private 
telegrams are sometimes known to the village before the actual 
information reaches the addressee.&nbsp; And in 1869 Lowestoft 
was not much more than a village, and telegraphy was in its 
infancy.&nbsp; Possibly Posh exaggerated the importance of 
secretiveness, and FitzGerald the security of privacy.&nbsp; But 
apart from all questions of &ldquo;the rights of the 
matter,&rdquo; what a letter it is!&nbsp; What a splendid 
justification for almost any action.&nbsp; I fear, however the 
matter in dispute be looked at, Posh cannot have the best of it 
in this case.&nbsp; He had fired up at an imaginary slight, 
wrong, whatever he chose to think it, and if he has any excuse at
all, it is that, but for his unreasonableness, we should not have
this letter.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>One would have thought that it might have given Posh 
pause if even he felt disposed to show his independence 
again.&nbsp; But this &ldquo;squall&rdquo; between these two 
curious partners was not destined to be the last.&nbsp; For the 
time it blew over, and the mutual relations between Posh and his 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; were as friendly as ever.</p>
<h2><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span

THE <i>HENRIETTA</i></h2>
<p>During the winter of 1869-70 it seems that Posh conceived the 
idea that the capital of the firm of FitzGerald and Fletcher 
justified the working partner in increasing the 
stock-in-trade.&nbsp; A boat-building company at Southwold put up
some craft at auction, and among them was one which had already 
seen a good deal of sea service named the <i>Henrietta</i>.&nbsp;
This Posh bought for about &pound;100 without consulting his 
partner.&nbsp; It transpired afterwards that the sale was not 
acceptable to all the shareholders of the company that owned the 
boat, especially to a Jerry Cole, one of the principal 
shareholders, and there was a good deal of bother for Posh in 
obtaining delivery of his purchase.&nbsp; It may be as well <!-- 
page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
140</span>to include all the letters relating to this transaction
in one chapter without regard to dates.</p>
<p>The first is dated February 1st&mdash;that is to say, February
1st, 1870&mdash;and was written at Woodbridge by FitzGerald to 
his partner.&nbsp; The letter, as handed to me by Posh, was 
incomplete, and lacked signature.&nbsp; No doubt the second sheet
had been lost with those &ldquo;sackfuls.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>February</i> 1<i>st</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Spalding was with me last night; and I asked him if
I was justified in the scolding I gave you about buying the 
Lugger and Nets too; telling him the particulars.&nbsp; He would 
not go so far as to say I was <i>wrong</i>; but he thought that 
you were not to blame either.&nbsp; Therefore I consider that I 
<i>was</i> wrong; and, as I told you, I am very glad to find 
myself wrong, though very sorry to have been so: and I cannot let
a day pass without writing to say so.&nbsp; <!-- page 141--><a 
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>You may 
think that I had better have said nothing to anybody about it: 
but I always do ask of another if I am right.&nbsp; If Mr. 
Spalding had been at Lowestoft at the time all this would not 
have happened: as it <i>has</i> happened, I wish to take all the 
blame on myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this will make you wish the more to be quit of such
a <i>Partner</i>.&nbsp; I am sure, however, that I <i>thought</i>
myself right: and am glad to recant.&nbsp; Perhaps another 
Partner would not do so much: but you say you will not have 
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Spalding thinks you would have done better to stick
to <i>one</i> Lugger, considering the double trouble of 
two.&nbsp; But he says he is not a proper judge.&nbsp; <i>I</i> 
think the chief evil is that this new Boat will keep you ashore 
in the Net-room, which I am persuaded hurts you.&nbsp; I told you
I was sure the <i>Dust</i> of the nets hurt you: and (oddly 
enough) the first thing I saw, on opening a Paper here on my 
return, was a <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Report on the influence of 
<i>Dust</i> in causing Disease.&nbsp; I hope you have seen the 
Doctor and told him all&mdash;about last Summer&rsquo;s 
Illness.&nbsp; Let me hear what he says.&nbsp; I should have 
advised <i>Worthington</i>, but he is very expensive.&nbsp; One 
thing I am sure of: <i>the more you eat</i>, <i>and the less you 
drink</i>, <i>the better</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even here, when Posh had obviously gone beyond his rights and 
bought another boat without consultation with his capitalist 
partner, FitzGerald shows his anxiety and solicitude for the 
man.</p>
<p>There <i>is</i> a good deal of dust flying about the net 
chambers; for the cutch and oil and thread all shred off and 
poison the air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Posh the other day,
&ldquo;he bought me one o&rsquo; them things that goo oover the 
mouth&rdquo; (a respirator), &ldquo;but lor!&nbsp; I should 
ha&rsquo; been ashamed ta be seed a wearin&rsquo; on 
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Worthington referred to in the letter <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>is one of a
long line of medical practitioners, and was the Lowestoft medical
attendant of FitzGerald himself.&nbsp; I have experienced great 
kindness from both this Dr. Worthington and his son Dr. Dick 
Worthington.&nbsp; The former tells me that FitzGerald would 
never enter his house, but would stand on the doorstep to 
consult.&nbsp; He had no objection to the doctor entering his 
(FitzGerald&rsquo;s) lodgings, and on one occasion when Dr. 
Worthington called on him at 12 Marine Terrace the doctor saw all
his medicine bottles unopened in a row.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know 
this isn&rsquo;t fair to me,&rdquo; said the justly irritated 
doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do what I can for you, and you won&rsquo;t
take my medicines.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear doctor,&rdquo; 
said FitzGerald, &ldquo;it does me good to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Aldis Wright says that this is merely an instance of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s rule that he would never enter the house of 
his equal.&nbsp; Of course his &ldquo;social&rdquo; equal is 
inferred, for <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the rule would have been unnecessary
if the &ldquo;equal&rdquo; bore another significance.&nbsp; His 
inferiors in station he would visit and charm by his manner and 
speech.&nbsp; But the house of a society equal he avoided, lest 
he should be compelled, for mere courtesy, to go where he would 
not.</p>
<p>I have, of course, chuckled over the opinion that Dr. 
Worthington senior was &ldquo;very expensive.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I 
believe that FitzGerald was one of those (I might almost say 
&ldquo;of us&rdquo;) who regarded all doctor&rsquo;s bills as 
luxuries!&nbsp; At all events, if FitzGerald was right, I can say
that Dr. Dick Worthington is not atavistic in this 
particular!</p>
<p>Mr. Spalding&rsquo;s opinion inclined FitzGerald to make no 
difficulty about finding the money for the 
<i>Henrietta</i>.&nbsp; He lodged it at his bankers&rsquo; for 
Posh to draw when occasion required.&nbsp; But Posh seems to have
been a little in advance.&nbsp; There is no heading whatever to 
the following letter.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear 
Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your letter.&nbsp; That which 
I had on <i>Friday</i>, enclosing Mr. Craigie&rsquo;s, said that 
you had not <i>drawn</i> the money, your letter of <i>To-day</i> 
tells me that you <i>had</i> drawn the money, <i>before the 
Letter from Southwold</i> came.&nbsp; Was not that letter Mr. 
Craigie&rsquo;s letter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I think you ought not (after all I have said) 
to have drawn the money (to keep in your house) till you wanted 
it.&nbsp; And you could have got it at the Bank <i>any</i> 
morning on which you got <i>another</i> letter from Southwold, 
telling you the business was to be settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, I think you should have written me on 
<i>Saturday</i>, in answer to my letter.&nbsp; You are very good 
in attending to any letters of mine about stores, or fish, which 
I don&rsquo;t care about.&nbsp; But you somehow do not attend so 
regularly to things which I <i>do</i> care about, such as gales 
of wind in which you are out, and such directions as <!-- page 
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>I 
have given over and over again about money matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I don&rsquo;t mean to kick up another row; 
provided you <i>now</i> do, and at once, what I positively 
desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is; to take the money directly to Mr. Barnard, 
and ask him, as from <i>me</i>, to pay it to my account at 
Messrs. Bacon and Cobbold&rsquo;s Bank at Woodbridge.&nbsp; Then 
if you tell me the address of the Auctioneer or Agent, at 
Southwold who manage [<i>sic</i>] the business, Bacon and Cobbold
will write to them at <i>once</i> that the money is ready for 
them directly the Lugger is ready for you.&nbsp; And, write me a 
line to-morrow to say that this is done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This makes a trouble to you, and to me, and to Bankers,
but I think you must blame yourself for not attending to my 
directions.&nbsp; But I am yours not the less.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. FG.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Craigie was an old Southwold friend of the Fletcher 
family, with whom Fletcher <!-- page 147--><a 
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>senior 
(Posh&rsquo;s father) had spent Christmas for over forty 
years.&nbsp; The criticism of Posh&rsquo;s system appears, to the
impartial critic, to be both painful and true.&nbsp; But Posh, in
this case, was not altogether to blame.&nbsp; This Mr. Jerry 
Cole, before mentioned, was keeping things back.&nbsp; He had a 
preponderating interest in that Southwold company, and he thought
that the <i>Henrietta</i> had been sold too cheap, and that hung 
up the delivery.&nbsp; At least that&rsquo;s what Posh tells me, 
and at this date I can&rsquo;t get any better evidence than 
his.</p>
<p>Shortly after the last letter FitzGerald wrote again.&nbsp; 
Now his kind anxiety about this man, whom he still loved, 
outweighed all thought of money.&nbsp; It was a bitter winter, 
and Posh, he thought, was not over-hale.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Saturday</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Captain</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is to be done about the money, do not you go 
over to Southwold <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>while this weather lasts.&nbsp; I 
think it is colder than I ever knew.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go, I 
say&mdash;there can be no hurry for the boat (even if you 
<i>can</i> get it) for a a [<i>sic</i>] week or so.&nbsp; Perhaps
it may be as well at Southwold as at Lowestoft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you were here to play Allfours with me 
To-night.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours,<br />
&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Posh got the lugger in March, 1870, and on March 2nd 
FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 
118): &ldquo;Posh has, I believe, gone off to Southwold in hope 
to bring his Lugger home.&nbsp; I advised him last night to 
ascertain first by letter whether she <i>were</i> ready for his 
hands; but you know he will go his own way, and that generally is
as good as anybody&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He now works all day in his 
Net-loft: and I wonder how he keeps as well as he is, shut up 
there from fresh air and among frowsy Nets. . . .&nbsp; I think 
he has mistaken in not sending the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> to the 
West this <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>spring. . . .&nbsp; But I have not 
meddled, nor indeed is it my Business to meddle now. . . 
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this must have been written about the date of the 
letter with which I commence the next chapter, or possibly a 
little later.&nbsp; It would, almost certainly, be <i>after</i> 
the catches of mackerel mentioned by &ldquo;Mr. Manby&rdquo; as 
hereinafter appears, and, very likely, after the termination of 
the partnership.</p>

THE END OF THE PARTNERSHIP</h2>
<p>Either in March or April, 1870, FitzGerald wrote to Posh the 
quaint letter which follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wanted you to puzzle yourself about the 
Accounts any more, but only to tell me at a rough estimate what 
the chief expenses were&mdash;as, for instance, Shares, 
&amp;c.&mdash;I beg to say that I <i>never had</i> asked 
you&mdash;nor had you told me this at Lowestoft: if you had I 
should not have wanted to ask again.&nbsp; And my reason 
<i>for</i> asking, was simply that, on Monday Mr. Moor here was 
<i>asking me</i> about what a Lugger&rsquo;s expenses were, and I
felt it silly not to be able to tell him the least about it: and 
I <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
151</span>have felt so when some one asked me before: and that is
why I asked you.&nbsp; I neither have, nor ever had, any doubt of
your doing your best: and you ought not to think so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>must please yourself</i> entirely about 
Plymouth: I only wish to say that I had not spoken as if I wanted
you to go.&nbsp; Go by all means if you like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I paid the Landlady of the Boat Inn for Newson and
Jack she asked me if you had explained to me about the Grog 
business.&nbsp; I said that you could not understand it at first,
but afterwards supposed that others might have been treated at 
night.&nbsp; She said&mdash;Yes; drinking rum-flip till two in 
the morning.&nbsp; She says it was Newson&rsquo;s doing, but I 
think <i>you</i> should have told me <i>at once</i>, particularly
as your not doing so left me with some suspicion of the 
Landlady&rsquo;s fair dealing.&nbsp; You did not choose to leave 
the blame to Newson, I suppose, but I think I deserve the truth 
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

it.</p>

<p>Mr. Moor was FitzGerald&rsquo;s Woodbridge lawyer, and no 
doubt he and other friends of FitzGerald thought that the affairs
of the partnership of FitzGerald and Fletcher were not carried on
with such precision as was desirable.&nbsp; Possibly they were 
right.&nbsp; But then, Posh couldn&rsquo;t be precise.&nbsp; I 
have failed to get any intelligible account out of Posh as to 
that rum-flip orgy.&nbsp; All he could do was to chuckle.&nbsp; 
The question of loyalty raised in the letter is a nice one.&nbsp;
But Posh and his kind would only answer it in one way.&nbsp; They
would regard it as treachery to their order to betray each other 
to a &ldquo;gennleman,&rdquo; however kind the 
&ldquo;gennleman,&rdquo; may have been.</p>
<p>On April 4th FitzGerald wrote to Posh from 
Woodbridge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear 
Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>may be</i> at Lowestoft some time next week.&nbsp;
As it is I have still some engagements here; and, moreover, I 
have not been quite well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to see me, you have only to come over here 
any day you choose.&nbsp; To-morrow (Sunday) there is a Train 
from Lowestoft which reaches Woodbridge at about 3 in the 
afternoon.&nbsp; I tell you this in case you might want to see or
speak to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Manby told me yesterday that there was a wonderful 
catch of Mackerel down in the West.&nbsp; I have no doubt that 
this warm weather and fine nights has to do with it.&nbsp; I 
believe that we are in for a spell of such weather:&mdash;but I 
suppose you have no thought of going Westward now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have desired that a . . . [word missing] of the Green
Paint which Mr. Silver used should be sent to you.&nbsp; But do 
not you <i>wait</i> for it, if you want to be about the Lugger 
<!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
154</span>at once.&nbsp; The paint <i>will keep</i> for another 
time: and I suppose that the sooner the Lugger is afloat this hot
and dry weather the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember me to your Family.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours always,<br />
&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Manby has been already mentioned, and we have previously 
heard of the excellence of Mr. Silver&rsquo;s green paint.&nbsp; 
But this letter must have been almost the last written by the 
sleeping partner before the termination of the partnership; for 
on April the 12th Mr. W. T. Balls, of Lowestoft, valued the 
<i>Meum and Tuum</i>, and &ldquo;Herring and Mackerel Nets, 
Bowls, Warpropes, Ballast, and miscellaneous Fishing Stock 
belonging jointly to Edward FitzGerald and Joseph 
Fletcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FitzGerald had started Posh, put him on his legs, and, as he 
believed, given him a chance to become a successful 
&ldquo;owner.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 155--><a 
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>But the 
poet was weary of the partnership.&nbsp; He had found it 
impossible to persuade Posh to keep accounts such as should be 
kept in every business, and had been disappointed more than once 
by the intemperance of the man.&nbsp; But as yet the kindly, 
generous-hearted gentleman had no thought of breaking with his 
prot&eacute;g&eacute; altogether, or of depriving him of the use 
of the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> or <i>Henrietta</i>, both of which 
had been bought with his, FitzGerald&rsquo;s, money.&nbsp; But he
would no longer be a partner.&nbsp; So Mr. Balls was called in to
value the stock-in-trade, with a view to arranging that a bill of
sale for the half-value to which FitzGerald was entitled should 
be given him, and that Posh should thereafter carry on the 
business of a herring-boat owner by himself, subject to the 
charge in favour of his old &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the various &ldquo;squalls,&rdquo; there had, as yet, 
been no serious quarrel between these two.&nbsp; Indeed, 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s kind heart <!-- page 156--><a 
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>never 
forgot Posh, and the fascination of the man.&nbsp; But for the 
future FitzGerald and Posh were no longer partners.&nbsp; 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s experience as a &ldquo;herring merchant&rdquo;
was at an end.</p>

POSH&rsquo;S PORTRAIT</h2>
<p>Previously to the termination of the partnership FitzGerald 
had commissioned S. Laurence to paint a portrait of Posh.&nbsp; 
On the 13th January, 1870, he wrote to Laurence from Woodbridge 
(<i>Letters</i>, II, 113, Eversley Edition):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . .&nbsp; If you were down here, I think 
I should make you take a life-size Oil Sketch of the Head and 
Shoulders of my Captain of the Lugger.&nbsp; You see by the 
enclosed&rdquo; (a copy of the photograph of 1870, no doubt) 
&ldquo;that these are neither of them a bad sort: and the 
Man&rsquo;s Soul is every way as well proportioned, missing in 
nothing that may become a Man, as I believe.&nbsp; He and I will,
I doubt, part Company; well as he <!-- page 158--><a 
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>likes me, 
which is perhaps as well as a sailor cares for any one but Wife 
and Children: he likes to be, what he is born to be, his own sole
Master, of himself, and of other men.&nbsp; So now I have got him
a fair start, I think he will carry on the Lugger alone: I shall 
miss my Hobby, which is no doubt the last I shall ride in this 
world: but I shall also get eased of some Anxiety about the lives
of a Crew for which I now feel responsible. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 20th FitzGerald wrote another letter to Laurence on
the same subject.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . .&nbsp; I should certainly like a large
Oil-sketch like Thackeray&rsquo;s, done in your most hasty, and 
worst, style, to hang up with Thackeray and Tennyson, with whom 
he shares a certain Grandeur of Soul and Body.&nbsp; As you 
guess, the colouring is (when the Man is all well) the finest 
Saxon type: with that complexion which Montaigne <!-- page 
159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span>calls &lsquo;vif, M&acirc;le, et flamboyant&rsquo;; 
blue eyes; and strictly auburn hair, that any woman might sigh to
possess.&nbsp; He says it is coming off, as it sometimes does 
from those who are constantly wearing the close, hot 
Sou&rsquo;-westers.&nbsp; We must see what can be done about a 
Sketch&rdquo; (<i>Letters</i>, II, 115, Eversley Edition).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February of the same year FitzGerald went down to 
Lowestoft, and wrote another letter from there with reference to 
the proposed portrait (<i>Letters</i>, II, 115, Eversley 
Edition).&nbsp; It is obvious from these letters that there was 
no bitterness on his side which led to the ending of the 
partnership.&nbsp; His long-suffering endured to the last.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Laurence</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . I came here a few days ago, for the benefit of my
old Doctor, The Sea, and my Captain&rsquo;s Company, which is as 
good.&nbsp; <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>He has not yet got his new Lugger 
home; but will do so this week, I hope; and then the way for us 
will be somewhat clearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you sketch a head, you might send it down to me to 
look at, so as I might be able to guess if there were any 
likelihood in that way of proceeding.&nbsp; Merely the Lines of 
Feature indicated, even by Chalk, might do.&nbsp; As I told you, 
the Head is of the large type, or size, the proper Capital of a 
six-foot Body, of the broad dimensions you see in the 
Photograph.&nbsp; The fine shape of the Nose, less than Roman, 
and more than Greek, scarce appears in the Photograph; the Eye, 
and its delicate Eyelash, of course will remain to be made out; 
and I think you excel in the Eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get home (which I shall do this week) I will 
send you two little Papers about the Sea words and Phrases used 
hereabout, for which this Man (quite unconsciously) is my main 
Authority.&nbsp; You will <!-- page 161--><a 
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>see in them
a little of his simplicity of Soul; but not the Justice of 
Thought, Tenderness of Nature, and all other good Gifts which 
make him a Gentleman of Nature&rsquo;s grandest Type.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

</a></p>
<p>The new Lugger was, of course, the <i>Henrietta</i>.&nbsp; The
portrait was, according to Posh, painted during the summer at 
Little Grange, the house which FitzGerald built for himself, or 
rather altered for himself, at Woodbridge.&nbsp; Dr. Aldis Wright
was under the impression that the portrait was never finished; 
but Posh is very certain about it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mind 
settin&rsquo; as still as a cat at a mouse-hole,&rdquo; says he, 
&ldquo;for ten min&rsquo;t or a quarter of an hour at a time, on 
and off, and then a stretchin&rsquo; o&rsquo; my legs in the 
yard.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I was somethin&rsquo; glad when that wuz 
finished, that I was!&nbsp; Tired! Lor! I niver knowed as 
dewin&rsquo; narthen&rsquo; would tire ye like that.&nbsp; The 
picter was sold at Mr. FitzGerald&rsquo;s sale, and bought by 
Billy Hynes o&rsquo; Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp; He <!-- page 
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
162</span>kep&rsquo; a public there.&nbsp; I reckon he&rsquo;s 
dead by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to the date of going to press I have been unable to trace 
this portrait, and it is, of course, possible, that in spite of 
Posh&rsquo;s vivid recollection, Dr. Aldis Wright&rsquo;s 
impression may be the right one.</p>
<p>A letter to Laurence of August 2nd, 1870, corroborates Posh to
the extent of proving that the painter had certainly seen the 
fisherman.&nbsp; On that date FitzGerald wrote (<i>Letters</i>, 
II, 118, Eversley Edition):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . The Lugger is now preparing in the 
Harbour beside me; the Captain here, there, and everywhere; with 
a word for no one but on business; the other side of the Man you 
saw looking for Birds&rsquo; Nests: all things in their 
season.&nbsp; I am sure the Man is fit to be King of a Kingdom as
well as of a Lugger. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, you and I have seen A Man!&nbsp; Have we 
not?&nbsp; Made in the mould of what <!-- page 163--><a 
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Humanity 
should be, Body and Soul, a poor Fisherman.&nbsp; The proud 
Fellow had better have kept me for a Partner in some of his 
responsibilities.&nbsp; But no; he must rule alone, as is right 
he should too. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; It would certainly have been better for Posh if he 
had kept his &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; for a partner.&nbsp; But
the &ldquo;squalls,&rdquo; the occasional beer bouts (or 
&ldquo;settin&rsquo; ins,&rdquo; as they call them in East 
Anglia), had excited the spirit of independence of my 
gentleman.&nbsp; Possibly FitzGerald himself had, by too open a 
display of his admiration for his partner, this typical 
longshoreman, contributed to the personal self-satisfaction which
must have been at the bottom of the man&rsquo;s reasons for 
wishing to be free of one who had befriended him so delicately 
and so generously.&nbsp; Posh himself admits, or rather boasts, 
that the &ldquo;break&rdquo; was owing to his own action.&nbsp; 
From first to last it seems that FitzGerald, the cultured 
gentleman, the scholar, the poet <!-- page 164--><a 
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>of perfect 
language and profound philosophy, regarded Posh as almost more 
than man&mdash;certainly as more than average man&mdash;and there
can be no greater token of the sweet simplicity of the 
scholar.</p>
<h2><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
A DROP O&rsquo; BARE</h2>
<p>In September, 1870 (which would be just before the home voyage
began and after the Northern voyage was over), Posh seems to have
&ldquo;celebrated&rdquo; more than his whilome partner and then 
mortgagee thought proper.&nbsp; On the 8th of the month 
FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 
119):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . I had a letter from Posh yesterday, 
telling me he was sorry we had not &lsquo;parted 
Friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; That he had been indeed &lsquo;<i>a little 
the worse</i> for Drink&rsquo;&mdash;which means being at a 
Public-house half the Day, and having to sleep it off the 
remainder: having been duly warned by his Father at Noon that all
had been ready for sailing 2 hours before, and all the other 
Luggers gone.&nbsp; As <!-- page 166--><a 
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Posh could 
<i>walk</i>, I suppose he only acknowledges a <i>little</i> 
Drink; but, judging by what followed on that little Drink, I wish
he had simply acknowledged his Fault.&nbsp; He begs me to write: 
if I do so I must speak very plainly to him: that, with all his 
noble Qualities, I doubt I can never again have Confidence in his
Promise to break this one bad Habit, seeing that He has broken it
so soon, when there was no occasion or excuse: unless it were the
thought of leaving his Wife so ill at home.&nbsp; The Man is so 
beyond others, as I think, that I have come to feel that I must 
not condemn him by general rule; nevertheless, if he ask me, I 
can refer him to no other.&nbsp; I must send him back his own 
written Promise of Sobriety, signed only a month before he broke 
it so needlessly: and I must even tell him that I know not yet if
he can be left with the Mortgage as we settled it in May. . . 
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I enclose Posh&rsquo;s letter, and the 
answer I propose to give to it.&nbsp; I am sure <!-- page 
167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>it
makes me sad and ashamed to be setting up for Judge on a much 
nobler Creature than myself. . . .&nbsp; I had thought of 
returning him his written Promise as worthless: desiring back my 
direction to my Heirs that he should keep on the Lugger in case 
of my Death. . . .&nbsp; I think Posh ought to be made to feel 
this severely: and, as his Wife is better I do not mind making 
him feel it if I can.&nbsp; On the other hand, I do not wish to 
drive Him, by Despair, into the very fault which I have so tried 
to cure him of. . . .&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His mother did not try to excuse him at all: his father would 
not even see him go off.&nbsp; She merely told me 
parenthetically, &ldquo;I tell him he seem to do it when the 
Governor is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If FitzGerald had not set poor Posh (for in a way I am sorry 
for the old fellow) on a pedestal, he would have understood that 
to a longshoreman or herring fisher who drinks <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>it (there 
are many teetotallers now), &ldquo;bare&rdquo; can never be 
regarded as an enemy.&nbsp; Posh did not think any excuse was 
necessary for having had, perhaps, more than he could 
conveniently carry.&nbsp; It was his last day ashore (though I 
can&rsquo;t quite understand what fishing he was going on unless 
the herring came down earlier than they do now), and he was 
&ldquo;injyin&rsquo; of hisself.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the old days 
they took a cask or so aboard.&nbsp; This is never done now, and 
the chief drink aboard is cocoa (pronounced, as FitzGerald 
writes, &ldquo;cuckoo&rdquo;).&nbsp; Posh no doubt thought 
himself hard done by that such a fuss should have been made about
a &ldquo;drarp o&rsquo; bare.&rdquo;&nbsp; He doubtless wished 
that FitzGerald should forgive him.&nbsp; For, despite his 
conduct, he did, I truly believe, love his 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for the father and mother, 
well, they smoothed down the &ldquo;gennleman&rdquo; and 
sympathised with their son according to their kind and to mother 
nature.&nbsp; The Direction to FitzGerald&rsquo;s Heirs, which he
<!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
169</span>refers to, is still in existence, and reads as 
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

the younger of Lowestoft stands indebted to me; provided he duly 
pays the Interest thereon; does his best to pay off the

Property so mortgaged until he pays it off.</p>

<p>This solemn injunction was written on a sheet of note-paper, 
and in the fold, over a sixpenny stamp, FitzGerald wrote: 
&ldquo;This paper I now endorse again on legal stamp, <!-- page

had in FitzGerald!</p>

THE SALE OF THE <i>SCANDAL</i></h2>
<p>Though the partnership was over, FitzGerald by no means gave 
up his friendship for Posh.&nbsp; From time to time he saw him, 
and from time to time he wrote to him, and always he retained the
affection for the longshoreman which had sprung up in him so 
suddenly and (I fear) so unaccountably.</p>
<p>On February 5th, 1871, FitzGerald wrote to Mr. Spalding 
(<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 121):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . Posh and his Father are very busy 
getting the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> ready for the West; Jemmy, who 
goes Captain, is just now in France with a <i>Cargoe</i> of salt 
Herrings.&nbsp; I suppose the Lugger will start in a fortnight or
so. . . .&nbsp; All-fours at night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

</a></p>
<p>Ablett Pasefield (or Percival), the fisherman and yacht hand, 
has been mentioned before, and will be mentioned again.&nbsp; He 
was one of FitzGerald&rsquo;s favourites.&nbsp; Mr. Kerrich was 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s brother-in-law, the husband of the 
poet&rsquo;s favourite sister, who had predeceased him in 
1863.&nbsp; On August 5th in that year FitzGerald wrote to 
Professor Cowell (<i>Letters</i>, II, 46, Eversley Edition): 
&ldquo;. . . I have lost my sister Kerrich, the only one of my 
family I much cared for, or who much cared for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Kerrich lived at Geldeston Hall, near Beccles, which is 
still in possession of the same family.</p>
<p>Mr. Berry (as we know) was FitzGerald&rsquo;s landlord at 
Markethill, Woodbridge.</p>
<p>At this time Posh was a man of means, and drove his smart gig 
and mare, and it was with some idea of buying a new horse <!-- 
page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
174</span>that he was to go to Woodbridge Horse Fair.&nbsp; In 
the seventies the horse fairs of Norwich and other East Anglian 
towns were important functions.&nbsp; The Rommany gryengroes had 
not then all gone to America, and those who know their George 
Borrow will remember with delight his description of the scene at
the horse fair on Norwich Castle Hill, when Jasper Petulengro 
first brought himself to the recollection of Lavengro (or the 
&ldquo;sap-engro&rdquo;) as his &ldquo;pal&rdquo;&mdash;that 
memorable day when George Borrow saw the famous entire Norfolk 
cob Marshland Shales led amongst bared heads, blind and grey with
age, but triumphant in his unequalled fame (<i>Lavengro</i>, p. 
74, Minerva Edition).</p>
<p>But Posh bought no new horse.&nbsp; And his recollection does 
not permit of any trustworthy account of his visit.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was during this trip to Woodbridge (and the carping
reader will be justified in saying &ldquo;and perhaps it 
wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo;) that <!-- page 175--><a 
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Posh 
witnessed the curious and characteristic meeting between 
FitzGerald and his wife.</p>
<p>If this meeting were characteristic, still more so was the 
history of the marriage.</p>
<p>FitzGerald had been a great friend of Bernard Barton, the 
Woodbridge quaker poet, and on the death of his friend he wished 
to save Miss Barton from being thrown on the world almost 
destitute and almost friendless.&nbsp; The only way of doing it 
without creating scandal (and he changed the name of his yacht 
from the <i>Shamrock</i> to the <i>Scandal</i> because he said 
that scandal was the principal commodity of Woodbridge) was to 
make her his wife.&nbsp; This he did.&nbsp; But there were many 
reasons why the marriage was not likely to prove a happy 
one.&nbsp; It did not, and both parties recognised that the 
wisest thing to do was to separate without any unnecessary 
fuss.&nbsp; They did so.&nbsp; And no doubt their action proved 
to be for the happiness of each of them.</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Posh was walking with FitzGerald on one occasion down 
Quay Lane, Woodbridge, when Mrs. FitzGerald (who was living at 
Gorleston at the time, but had gone over to Woodbridge, possibly 
to see some old friends) appeared walking towards them.&nbsp; 
FitzGerald removed the glove he was wearing on his right 
hand.&nbsp; Mrs. FitzGerald removed the glove she was wearing on 
her right hand.&nbsp; There was a momentary hesitation as the 
husband passed the wife.&nbsp; But Posh thinks that the two hands
did not meet.&nbsp; FitzGerald bowed with all his courtesy, and 
passed on.</p>
<p>Posh says that Mrs. FitzGerald was a &ldquo;fine figure of a 
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I believe that she was, indeed, so fine a
figure of a woman that the length of her stride excited the 
admiration of the local schoolboys when she was still Miss 
Barton.&nbsp; She was older than FitzGerald when he married her, 
and both were nearer fifty than forty.</p>
<p>In this context I give the following letter <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>from 
FitzGerald to Posh, though I have been unable to fix its date 
with any certainty.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>Tuesday</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find that I may very likely have to go to London on 
Thursday&mdash;not to be home till Friday perhaps.&nbsp; If I do 
this it will be scarce worth while your coming over here 
to-morrow, so far as <i>I</i> am concerned; though you will 
perhaps see Newson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor young Smith of the Sportsman was brought home ill 
last week, and died of the very worst Small Pox in a Day or 
two.&nbsp; There have been <i>three</i> Deaths from it here: all 
from London.&nbsp; As young Smith died in <i>Quay Lane</i> 
leading down to the Boat Inn, I should not like you to be about 
there with any chance of Danger, though I have been up and down 
several times myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Ever yours,<br />
&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Sportsman&rdquo; was a public-house at <!-- page 
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
178</span>Woodbridge, and it is probable that FitzGerald had 
helped &ldquo;poor young Smith&rdquo; substantially.&nbsp; His 
anxiety lest Posh should contract smallpox, and his indifference 
as to himself, are admirably illustrative of the man&rsquo;s 
unselfishness.</p>
<p>But now that the partnership was at an end he began to 
frequent Lowestoft less.&nbsp; During 1871 he sold the 
<i>Scandal</i>, and on September 4th he wrote to Dr. Aldis Wright
from Woodbridge (<i>Letters</i>, II, p. 126, Eversley Edition): 
&ldquo;I run over to Lowestoft occasionally for a few days, but 
do not abide there long: no longer having my dear little Ship for
company. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who bought the <i>Scandal</i> I do not know.&nbsp; Posh has no
recollection, and Dr. Aldis Wright has been unable to trace with 
certainty the subsequent owner of her, though he has reason to 
think that she was sold to Sir Cuthbert Quilter.&nbsp; She had 
served her purpose.&nbsp; She was, as Posh assures me, a 
&ldquo;fast and handy little schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>After her sale FitzGerald still remained the mortgagee 
of the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> and the <i>Henrietta</i>.&nbsp; But 
this was not to last indefinitely.&nbsp; Posh&rsquo;s spirit of 
independence and love of &ldquo;bare&rdquo; were fated to put an 
end to all business relations between his old 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; and him.</p>

BY ORDER OF THE MORTGAGEE</h2>
<p>Matters were still progressing fairly satisfactorily when 
FitzGerald visited Lowestoft in September, 1872.&nbsp; On the 
29th of that month he wrote to Mr. Spalding (<i>Two Suffolk 
Friends</i>, p. 122):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . Posh&mdash;after no fish caught for 3
weeks&mdash;has had his boat come home with nearly all her fleet 
of nets torn to pieces in last week&rsquo;s winds. . . . he . . .
went with me to the theatre afterwards, where he admired the 
&lsquo;Gays,&rsquo; as he called the Scenes; but fell asleep 
before Shylock had whetted his knife in the Merchant of Venice. .

<p>&ldquo;1st.&nbsp; As to your being <i>under</i> your Father: I
said no such thing: but wrote that he was to be <i>either</i> 
Partner, or (with your Mother) constantly employed, and consulted
with as to the Boats.&nbsp; It is indeed for <i>their</i> sakes, 
and that of your own Family, that I have come to take all this 
trouble</p>
<p>&ldquo;2ndly.&nbsp; As to the Bill of Sale to me.&nbsp; If you
could be calm enough, you would see that this would be a 
Protection <i>to yourself</i>.&nbsp; You do not pay your 
different Creditors <i>all</i> their Bill at the year&rsquo;s 
end.&nbsp; Now, if <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>any one of these should happen to 
want <i>all</i> his Money; he might, by filing a Bankruptcy 
against you, seize upon your Nets and everything else you have to
pay his Debt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to your supposing that <i>I</i> should use the Bill 
of Sale except in the last necessity (which I do not calculate 
upon), you prove that you can have but little remembrance of what
I have hitherto done for you and am still willing to do for your 
Family&rsquo;s sake quite as much as for your own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nets were included in the Valuation which Mr. Balls
made of the whole Property; which valuation (as you ought to 
remember) I reduced even lower than Mr. Balls&rsquo; Valuation; 
which you yourself thought too low at the time.&nbsp; Therefore 
(however much the Nets, &amp;c. may have been added to since) 
surely <i>I</i> have the first claim on them in Justice, if not 
by the Mortgage.&nbsp; I repeat, however, that I proposed the 
Bill of Sale quite as much as a <!-- page 183--><a 
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>Protection 
to yourself and yours as to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cannot see all this on reflection, there is no 
use my talking or writing more about it.&nbsp; You may ask Mr. 
Barnard, if you please, or any such competent person, if 
<i>they</i> object to the Bill of Sale, I shall not insist.&nbsp;
But you had better let me know what you decide on before the end 
of the week when I shall be going home, that I may arrange 
accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edward 
FitzGerald</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Barnard was a Lowestoft lawyer for whom Posh had no great 
love.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to say that he did not 
&ldquo;ask&rdquo; him.&nbsp; He still raises his voice and gets 
excited when he discusses the grievances of which he made 
complaint in the winter of 1873.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t 
leave me alone,&rdquo; says Posh.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was &lsquo;yew 
must ax yar faa&rsquo;er this, an&rsquo; yew must let yar mother 
that, and yew mustn&rsquo;t dew this here, nor yit that 
theer.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>At last I up an&rsquo; says, 
&lsquo;Theer!&nbsp; I ha&rsquo; paid ivery farden o&rsquo; 
debts.&nbsp; Look a here.&nbsp; Here be the receipts.&nbsp; Now 
I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;e no more on it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I slammed 
my fist down like this here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Posh&rsquo;s fist came down on my Remington&rsquo;s table 
till the bell jangled!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh dear! oh dear, Posh!&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;That it should ever come ta this!&nbsp; And hev yew 
anything left oover?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I say.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
matter of a hunnerd an&rsquo; four pound clear arter payin&rsquo;
ivery farden owin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the stock an&rsquo; nets 
an&rsquo; gear and tew boots <a name="citation184"></a><a 
href="#footnote184" class="citation">[184]</a> an&rsquo; all 
wha&rsquo;ss mortgaged ta yew.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;e no
more on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Ayther I&rsquo;m master or I ha&rsquo; 
done wi&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&nbsp; Posh,&rsquo; he say, 
&lsquo;I din&rsquo;t think as yew&rsquo;d made so 
much.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is Posh&rsquo;s account of the final disagreement which 
led to the sale of the boats in 1874.&nbsp; Even if it be true 
one cannot say that the bluff independence came off with flying 
colours in this particular instance.&nbsp; <!-- page 185--><a 
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>But 
FitzGerald could have told another story, if one may judge from 
his letter to Mr. Spalding of the 9th January, 1874, written from
Lowestoft (<i>Two Suffolk Friends</i>, p. 123):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . I have seen no more of Fletcher since
I wrote, though he called once when I was out. . . .&nbsp; I only
hope he has taken no desperate step.&nbsp; I hope so for his 
Family&rsquo;s sake, including Father and Mother.&nbsp; People 
here have asked me if he is not going to give up the business, 
&amp;c.&nbsp; Yet there is Greatness about the Man.&nbsp; I 
believe his want of Conscience in some particulars is to be 
referred to his <i>Salwaging</i> Ethics; and your Cromwells, 
C&aelig;sars, and Napoleons have not been more scrupulous.&nbsp; 
But I shall part Company with him if I can do so without Injury 
to his Family.&nbsp; If not I must let him go on <i>under 
some</i> &lsquo;<i>Surveillance</i>&rsquo;: he <i>must</i> wish 
to get rid of me also, and (I believe, though he says <i>not</i>)
of the Boat, if he could better himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Posh&rsquo;s story is that after the letter of December
31st, 1873, FitzGerald tried to find him.&nbsp; He went to his 
father&rsquo;s house, and (says Posh, which we are at liberty to 
doubt) &ldquo;cried like a child.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sent Posh a 
paper of conditions which must be agreed to if he, Posh, were to 
continue to have the use of the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> and the 
<i>Henrietta</i>.&nbsp; The last one was (Posh says, with a roar 
of indignation), &ldquo;that the said Joseph Fletcher the younger
shall be a teetotaller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;!&rdquo; says Posh, &ldquo;how my father did 
swear at him when I told him o&rsquo; that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt he did.&nbsp; And no doubt in the presence of 
FitzGerald the &ldquo;slim&rdquo; old Lowestoft longshoreman 
raised his mighty voice in wrath and indignation that he should 
have begotten a son to disgrace him so cruelly!&nbsp; FitzGerald 
was too open a man, too honest-hearted, too straightforward to 
understand that a father could encourage his son insidiously, and
swear at him, FitzGerald, <!-- page 187--><a 
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>at the same
time as he deprecated that son&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; But 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s eyes, long closed by kindness, were partly 
open at last.&nbsp; He would not go on without some better 
guarantee of conduct, some better security that the boats&rsquo; 
debts would be paid.&nbsp; On January 19th, 1874, he wrote to 
Posh (and the handwriting of the letter suggests disturbance of 
mind) from Woodbridge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I forgot to say, Fletcher, that I shall pay
for any work done to my two Boats, in case that you get another 
Boat to employ the Nets in.&nbsp; That you <i>should</i> get such
another Boat, is, I am quite sure, the best plan for you and for 
me also.&nbsp; As I wrote you before, I shall make over to you 
all my Right to the Nets on condition that you use them, or 
change them for others to be used, in the Herring Fishing, in any
other Boat which you may buy or hire.&nbsp; I certainly shall not
let you have the use of my Boats, unless under <i>some</i> 
conditions, <i>none</i> of which <!-- page 188--><a 
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>which 
[<i>sic</i>] you seemed resolved to submit to.&nbsp; It will save
all trouble if you take the offer I have made you, and the sooner
it is settled the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edward 
FitzGerald</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Posh &ldquo;worn&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; ta hev his 
faa&rsquo;er put oover him, nor he worn&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; ta 
take no pledge.&nbsp; Did ye iver hear o&rsquo; sich a 
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So in due course, on the 17th February, 1874, Mr. W. T. Balls,
of Lowestoft, sold by auction the &ldquo;Lugger <i>Meum and 
Tuum</i>&rdquo; (she had been converted into a dandy-rigged craft
about 1872) &ldquo;and the <i>Henrietta</i> by direction of 
Edward FitzGerald as mortgagee.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p200.jpg">
<img alt="Edward FitzGerald&rsquo;s gravestone in Boulge 
churchyard; at the head of the grave is a rose bush raised from 
seed brought from Omar&rsquo;s tomb" src="images/p200.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>So Mr. Balls writes me.&nbsp; But he has no letters from 
FitzGerald, and was kind enough to look up the valuation and sale
transactions in his books at my request.</p>
<p>The <i>Meum and Tuum</i> was a favourite of Posh&rsquo;s and 
he tried to buy her for himself.&nbsp; <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>But 
although she had only cost &pound;360 to build in 1867, in 1874 
she fetched over &pound;300, and Posh could not go so high as 
that.&nbsp; So he made other arrangements, and his fishing 
interests with FitzGerald were finally ended.</p>
<p>One would have thought that there would be no more letters 
beginning &ldquo;Dear Posh.&rdquo;&nbsp; But though FitzGerald 
had found himself obliged to end his association with Posh in the
herring fishing, he never ended his friendship, even if, during 
the last years of his life, he neither saw nor wrote to his 
former partner.</p>
<p>The <i>Meum and Tuum</i> made several more voyages in the 
North Sea and to the west, and, when she was no longer strictly 
seaworthy, was sold to a Mr. Crisp, of Beccles, a maltster and 
general provision merchant, who turned her into a storeship, and 
anchored her off his wharf in the river Waveney.&nbsp; When she 
became so rotten as to be unfit even for a storage ship she was 
<!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
190</span>broken up, and her name-board was bought by Captain 
Kerrich, of Geldeston Hall (the son of FitzGerald&rsquo;s 
favourite sister), who was kind enough to present it to the Omar 
Khayy&aacute;m Club.&nbsp; But as the club has no &ldquo;local 
habitation&rdquo;&mdash;only a name&mdash;it now remains in the 
charge of Mr. Frederic Hudson, one of the founders of the 
club.</p>
<h2><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
UNTO THIS LAST</h2>
<p>Posh does not remember the last occasion on which he spoke to 
his old &ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; but he says that whenever he
did see him he, FitzGerald, would take him by the blue woollen 
jersey and pinch him, and say, &ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear, 
Posh!&nbsp; To think it should ha&rsquo; come to 
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, this may possibly have been the 
case.&nbsp; There is no doubt that FitzGerald resumed friendly 
relations with the fisherman, for on August 29th, 1875, he wrote 
from Woodbridge to his former partner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Woodbridge</span>, <i>August</i> 29.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Posh</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have posted you a Lowestoft Paper telling you 
something of the Regatta there.&nbsp; But as you say you like to 
hear <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>from me also, I write to supply what
the Paper does not tell: though I wonder you can care to hear of 
such things in the midst of your Fishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, and every one else, made sure that the little 
<i>Sapphire</i> would do well when it came on to blow on 
Thursday: she went to her moorings as none of the others did 
except the <i>Red Rover</i>.&nbsp; But, directly the Gun fired, 
the <i>Otter</i> (an awkward thing) drove down upon, and broke up
her Chain-plates, or stenctions [<i>sic</i>], to which the wire 
rigging holds: so she could not sail at all: and the <i>Red 
Rover</i> got the Prize, after going only <i>two</i> rounds 
instead of <i>three</i>: which is odd work, I think.&nbsp; Major 
Leathes&rsquo; mast went over in the first round, as it did a 
year ago.&nbsp; At Evening, the <i>Otter</i> grounded as she lay 
by the South Pier: and would have knocked her bottom out had not 
Ablett Pasifull gone off to her and made them hoist their 
main-sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ablett and Jack got more and more uncomfortable <!-- 
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
193</span>with their new Owner, who is a Fool as well as a 
Screw.&nbsp; At last Ablett told him that he himself and Jack had
almost been on the point of leaving him, and <i>that</i>, I 
think, will bring him to his senses, if anything can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Friday we saw <i>Mushell</i> coming in deeply laden,
and we heard how he had just missed putting three lasts on board 
of you.&nbsp; I sent off a Telegram to you that same evening, as 
Mushell knew you would be anxious to know that he had come in 
safe through the wind and Sea of Thursday night.&nbsp; He was to 
have started away again on Sunday: but one of his men who had 
gone home had not returned by one o&rsquo;clock, when I came 
away.&nbsp; <i>This</i>, I always say, is one of the Dangers of 
coming home, but, as Things were, <i>Mushell</i> could scarce 
help it, though he had better have gone to Yarmouth to sell his 
Fish.&nbsp; He seems a good Fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these mishaps&mdash;I wonder any man can carry on 
the trade!&nbsp; I think I would <!-- page 194--><a 
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>rather be 
in my own little Punt again.&nbsp; But, while you will go on, you
know I will stand by you.&nbsp; Your mare is well, and the sore 
on her Shoulder nearly gone.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Howe send their 
Regards.&nbsp; Cowell is gone off to Devonshire instead of coming
to meet me at Lowestoft: but I dare say I shall run over there 
again before long.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours always,<br />
&ldquo;E. FG.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;little <i>Sapphire</i>&rdquo; I cannot 
identify.&nbsp; One gentleman has been kind enough to try to help
me, and thinks that she was the <i>Scandal</i>.&nbsp; But this 
cannot be so, for the <i>Scandal</i> was built for FitzGerald at 
Wyvenhoe in 1863, was first called the <i>Shamrock</i> and then 
the <i>Scandal</i>.&nbsp; Personally, I remember the names of a 
good many of the yachts of the Norfolk and Suffolk coast of the 
period, but I can&rsquo;t identify the <i>Sapphire</i>.&nbsp; The
<i>Red Rover</i> was a river craft, a cutter, with the one big 
jib of our river craft <!-- page 195--><a 
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>instead of 
jib and foresail, belonging to the late Mr. Sam Nightingale, of 
Lacon&rsquo;s Brewery.&nbsp; She was originally about twelve 
tons, but by improvements and additions, when Mr. Nightingale 
died in the eighties, was eighteen tons.&nbsp; For many years she
was the fastest yacht in the Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club, and 
though she was occasionally beaten on fluky days she never lost 
possession of the challenge cup for long.&nbsp; Fred Baldry, who 
steered her with extraordinary skill, is, I believe, still alive,
and lives on Cobholm Island, Yarmouth.</p>
<p>The <i>Red Rover</i> was not only successful on the rivers and
Broads, but in the Yarmouth Roads.&nbsp; I was on her when she 
was beating the famous Thames twenty-tonner <i>Vanessa</i>, when 
the <i>Red Rover</i> carried away her bowsprit (a new stick) as 
she was beating on the sands to dodge the tide, and I remember 
how we were hooted all the way up Gorleston Harbour when Mr. 
William Hall&rsquo;s steam launch towed us in.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>I believe that when the little ten-ton <i>Buttercup</i>
(unbeaten at her best) came down and gave the poor old <i>Red 
Rover</i> the worst dressing down she had ever experienced it 
broke Mr. Nightingale&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; He died soon after, 
and he left a direction in his will that the <i>Red Rover</i> 
should be broken up and burnt.&nbsp; It would, I think, have been
a kinder and better direction to have left the yacht to Fred 
Baldry, who had steered her to victory so often.</p>
<p>Although I have described her as a river yacht, she was purely
a racing machine, and used to be accompanied (in the home waters 
at all events) by a wherry, with all spare spars and sails, on 
which everything unnecessary for sailing was stowed before the 
starting gun was fired.</p>
<p>Once a year she carried a picnic party over Breydon Water, on 
which occasion, I believe, Mrs. Nightingale was invariably 
seasick going over to Breydon.&nbsp; Neither Mr. nor Mrs. 
Nightingale ever used her for <!-- page 197--><a 
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>pleasure 
except on that one annual excursion up to Reedham.</p>
<p>Well, well!&nbsp; There are no <i>Red Rovers</i> now, and no 
Fred Baldrys coming on.&nbsp; But there are plenty of stinking 
black tugs and filthy coal barges embellishing the lovely Norfolk
waters.&nbsp; I do not wonder that Colonel Leathes, mentioned in 
the last quoted letter, has taken his yacht <i>off</i> the public
waters and confined her to the beautiful wooded reaches of 
Fritton Mere.</p>
<p>The <i>Otter</i> was a rival of the <i>Red Rover</i> in the 
early days of the latter yacht, and was a clumsy, rather ugly, 
ketch-rigged craft belonging to Sir Arthur Preston.&nbsp; Major 
Leathes&rsquo; (now Colonel Leathes) boat was a yawl named the 
<i>Waveney Queen</i>, and the Colonel tells me that he carried 
away his mast twice, each time because he would &ldquo;carry 
on&rdquo; too long.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t ascertain who was the &ldquo;new owner&rdquo; of
Ablett Percival and Jack&mdash;and if I could I suppose it 
wouldn&rsquo;t do to name <!-- page 198--><a 
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>him, in 
view of FitzGerald&rsquo;s stringent criticism of him.&nbsp; 
Subsequently Jack Newson went on the <i>Mars</i>, the sea-going 
craft belonging to the late J. J. Colman, <span 
class="smcap">m.p.</span>, but this was later than 1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mushell&rdquo; was the nickname of Joe Butcher, the 
former skipper of the <i>Henrietta</i>, under Posh, as owner.</p>
<p>I must admit that this letter is hard to fit in with the year 
1875, when the <i>Meum and Tuum</i> and the <i>Henrietta</i> had 
been sold, and the separation between Posh and his 
&ldquo;guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; final, so far as herring fishing was 
concerned.&nbsp; The last paragraph, in which FitzGerald writes 
that so long as Posh goes on he will stand by him, seems in flat 
contradiction to what happened in 1874.&nbsp; But Colonel Leathes
puts the date as 1875, and Dr. Aldis Wright has been kind enough 
to look up old almanacs in his possession and corroborates this 
view.&nbsp; It speaks with extraordinary eloquence of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s affection for Posh, of his <!-- page 199--><a 
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>patience 
with the man, that after the want of recognition of his kindness 
shown in 1874 he should have written to him in such a manner in 
1875.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Howe&rdquo; were, as I have stated before,
the caretakers at Little Grange.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cowell&rdquo; was, 
no doubt, Professor Cowell, though it seems strange that 
FitzGerald should have mentioned him to Posh without any prefix 
to his name.</p>
<p>That is the last letter in which I can find any reference to 
Posh, and the last letter in Posh&rsquo;s possession which was 
written to him.&nbsp; I dare say there were later letters, but if
so they have been destroyed.</p>
<p>FitzGerald had tried a new experiment, and it was ended.</p>
<blockquote><p>Myself, when young, did eagerly frequent<br />
Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About it and about: but evermore<br />
Came out by the same door wherein I went.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had found a new love, a new interest, and believed that he 
had found a new trustworthiness.&nbsp; <!-- page 200--><a 
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>But he 
returned through the same door by which he entered; and he was an
old man for disillusionment.</p>
<p>Posh was, no doubt, rude, harsh, overbearing with the old 
gentleman, but his eyes grow moist now when he speaks of 
him.&nbsp; I think he would surrender a good deal of his boasted 
independence if only he could have FitzGerald for his friend 
again.</p>
<p>The last time he was with me I read him</p>
<blockquote><p>The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br />
Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br 
/>
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well tha&rsquo;ss a rum un!&rdquo; said Posh.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
